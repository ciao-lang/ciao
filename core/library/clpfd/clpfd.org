*** TODO Fix the Ciao bug that doesn't permit debugging the library. 
    This doesn't work:

    ?- set_prolog_flag(check_cycles,on).
*** TODO How to make Ciao do that inlining automatically:
    min(X, Min):-
	get_range(X, Range),
	fd_range:get_min(Range, Min).

    Ideally, the compiler should inline get_range to obtain a
    specialized version:

    min(fd_var(_,R, _), Min):-
	fd_range:get_min(R, Min).

*** TODO Kill the integration roadmap below. Mainly documentation work.
*** TODO Benchmark the pure-fd_var branch. (The one without a term)
*** TODO Remove duplicate code for supporting optim comp and js_backend
*** TODO Clean up the mess in the CLPFD to FD compilation.
    Right now there is a translation module (written by Mcarro) and an
    interpretation. Kill the interpreter. We need to implement also
    the idea of meta information on definitions of fd_constraints.
*** TODO Implement a optimization from Diaz, Codognet
*** TODO Better study the implications of allowing empty ranges. 
    EG: My initial guess is that current behavior is not problematic.
*** TODO Implement a range module using trees with a pivot.
*** TODO Bits range Still not working on all benchs.
*** TODO We need more benchmarks.
*** TODO Implement instrumentation and debug.
    EG: I had some ideas here, will try to recover.
* Design of the library
  Primary reference: paper on CICLOPs 2012

  The library is based on the indexicals paradigms (See [Diaz, Codognet])
*** Principles of design
    The library is split in several parts:
***** compiler from clpfd to indexicals [clpfd, clpfd_tr]:
      This part extends Ciao syntax in order to support CLPFD expressions.

      Main work is to analize a CLPFD expression and translate it into
      a set of indexicals. Usually, translation requires linearization
      of predicates.
***** indexicals library [clpfd_idx]:
      The main library, it should export information about the
      available indexicals such that the compiler can perform in an
      optimal fashion.
***** compiler from indexicals to prolog [indexicals_tr]:
      Indexicals are defined using a custom language, so the compiler
      must translate each indexical to a set of indexicals primitives.
***** indexicals runtime [indexicals_rt]:
      Support predicates such as fd_tell, it includes the attributed
      variables logic.
***** range [clpfd_ranges]:
      Implementation of FD ranges. Two implementations are available.

      Clear candidate to rewriting to C
***** clpfd runtime [clpfd_rt]:
      Here we have support routines and main CLPFD predicates, such as
      labelling, in, etc...
*** Design objetives:
    - Prolog implementación.
    - Use of attributed variables.
    - Integration with CiaoPP.
    - FD Expression compatibility with existing solvers.
    - Reasonable speed.
    - Easy to hack around.
    - Uses the package facility in order to extend syntax.
*** Indexicals
*** CLPFD
* Integration roadmap
*** "Administrative" tasks
***** DONE Commit to the Ciao repository
      I've committed it under contrib.
***** DONE How to test the library?
      I don't know how to compile the library once it is integrated
      into CIAO's main repository. Should I use make?
***** TODO How to test documentation?
      Emilio couldn't figure out how to test the
      documentation. Please, write here the command I should use to
      generate the docs and I will start writing some.
***** TODO Write documentation
*** Technical problems & Development
    We have some technical problems preventing a release-quality
    constraint solver. Ordered by priority.
***** [#A] Fast metacall
      Finite domain variables must execute some predicates when
      unified. Right now we are using call_in_module which is very
      slow. We should investigate a faster approach. See metacall_test
      for more details.
******* Call approach
      :- meta_predicate wrapper(:)
      wrapper(X) :- call(X).
      X = mod:pred(...)
******* Jfran's commit 14266 appers to solve that.
***** [#A] Enhance IDX library
      We need to add many more indexicals.
***** [#A] Finish FD -> IDX translation
      The translation of fd expressions into indexicals is not really
      smart. It should detect the indexicals available in the library
      and use them.
***** [#C] Term attributes
      We need to record when a variable became instantiated, in the
      term if possible. I'm afraid this is hard to do given the nature
      of unification and term sharing, what would happen in
      a = A, expensive, a = B
      ?
      Of course the solution is that attach_term_attribute performs a copy_term.
***** [#C] C interface (write a new range implementation)
* Benchs (may be out of date)

Status of the solver:
--------------------

"the first 1000 lines of code are the hardest to write", indeed, this
has been my case, as my first approach was to write the solver at the
WAM level, which was proved to be not the right choice.

After speaking with jfran (big thanks to him too), it was clear to me
that writing the solver in C would not succeed, so a pure Prolog
approach was taken.

Basically, the solver has two packages, namely indexicals.pl and
clpfd.pl which allow to write indexicals and high level fd code.

The indexicals package compiles all to special fd code, generating
lots of new predicates, that's all.

Then the module indexicals_rt contains all the primitive indexicals
operations.

Two auxiliary modules are needed, namely clpfd_range and
clpfd_chain. Both define an interface for fd ranges and fd call
chains, so the core remains completely abstracted from implementation
details.

The clpfd package is very basic at the moment, just compiling full fd
expression to suitable indexicals ones. More on that later on.

A very informal test on performance can be found in the Doc file.

I'd say that I've really enjoyed developing this solver, although the
start was a little hard (due to my non-knowledge about constraint
solving in general), I've had to learn a whole lot about the topic and
it's been a really interesting learning experience.

Open issues:
------------

I consider the solver ready for performing small demos, and its
performance is not that bad, but there are a lot of open questions:

- Chains:

  The core of the solver is the constraint re-execution code found in
  clpfd_chains.pl. Given that any FD variable can contain an arbitrary
  number of primitive constraints to be called.

  The primitives constraints are compiled to a Prolog predicate, and
  the chain is represented using a list. This has the big advantage
  that the prim constraint closure is represented just by the term
  itself, as attr vars don't perform a copy_term in the attributes.

  Unfortunately, this implies that constraint calling have to be
  performed using $meta_call, which is *very slow* from my preliminary
  tests.

  As chains are completely abstracted by the clpfd_chain module, one
  possible solution would be to have a special $fd_fast_call pred,
  which goes the fast path.

- Ranges:

  Writing chain handling code was a little tedious at first, but the
  solver has two different chain implementations, one based on range
  lists and the other one using arbitrary bit vectors.

  Two points should be noted:

  - It seems that performance improvements by using the bit vectors
    are not so big, and what is more, are constant, as can be seen in
    the following table:

  | Queens | Lists | Bits | Ratio  |
  | 16     | 4372  | 3464 | 126.2% |
  | 17     | 2652  | 2180 | 126.6% |

  - The clpfd_range* case is an ideal use case of herme's proposal
    "modules as objects". In this case both modules provide the same
    interface, but there's no clear way to use one or another in
    runtime, without adding non trivial execution overhead.

  Note that some new range operations are not implemented yet in the
  bit-using module.

  Ideally, coding ranges in C should be very easy.

- Documentation:

  Yes, I'm a lazy ********, and the code as is now includes no
  documentation nor assertions for the final user. However, it is
  reasonably commented.

  I promise I'll write that shortly, once I the solver is more stable
  than now.

- Compiling high level expressions and special indexicals.

  Basing the solver in the indexicals method, means that high level fd
  constraints are compiled to primitive ones, which are defined by
  means of the indexicals.

  Indexicals language is very powerful in the sense that you have
  absolute control about the var's range, instantiation state, etc...,
  but is also means that lots of special indexicals should be written
  to get an efficient solver. 

  A common case is when one of the parameters is known to be ground in
  advance, which results in one primitive constraint less in the
  system, compare:

'a<>b+c'(X, Y, Z) +:
	X in -{val(Y)+val(Z)},
	Y in -{val(X)-val(Z)},
	Z in -{val(X)-val(Y)}.

vs.

'a<>b+t'(X, Y, Z) +:
	X in -{val(Y)+c(Z)},
	Y in -{val(X)-c(Z)}.

  Just you can feel the importance of using the right indexical, see
  the numbers in the queens bench using a special one:

Queens 17:

idx used    |  Time |
a<>b+t      |  2652 |
a<>b+c      |  3768 |
a<>b, a+b=c | 50307 |

(t means t is not a var, a<>b, a+b=c means no special idx for the
sum+diseq case exist, so a new var must be created)

  Choosing the right indexical can be done either at compile time or
  at runtime.

  But, this is were the original M. Hermenegildo's idea comes to play,
  using CiaoPP and assertions to greatly improve the solver's
  performance.

  Abstract domains that come now to my mind are:

  - Standard ones for groundness, etc...
  - "Continuous ranges" I mean E in {1..3} vs E in {1,3,5}
  - Domain modifications: Lattices like bot -> min -> tot, etc...
                                            \> max />

  Anyways, the high level compiler needs lots of work, my preliminary
  plan is to provide misinformation about the indexicals to the HL
  compiler, so it can profit automatically from new added indexicals.

  The next step would mean integrating this with ciaoPP.

- Non linear constraints:

  Non-linear constraints are very tricky, as you have to trade domain
  consistency against speed.

  I'm also working on this, and I believe that very big improvements
  could be made, mostly in cooperation with the previous point.

- Profiler and writing a c solver:

  I've really missed a profiler for Ciao :) Yes, I know you know about
  this, but for this kind of program profiling is a must, you can
  really see the big picture and modify/adapt the design in basis to
  the present hotspots.

  At one point I started to write my own stupid profiler, but then I
  had a look to the existing one (profiler package) and I realized
  that is almost identical to what I was going to do.

  So I'd like to hack in that profiler, also it should be a good point
  to start adding C code to the solver. I know the profiler is a work
  in progress, so maybe getting in touch with the person writing it
  and having a short talk would be a good start for me, I you don't
  mind.

- Reification

  I've not implemented constraint reification yet. My reasons are:

  - I'm writing a BDD solver in Prolog, and I'd like to explore the
    space of solver cooperation in this case. (I'm aware about
    Shamir's interface to the BDD library)

  - Is not top priority IMHO.

- Future work

  My plan is to actively work in the solver for a long time, after all
  it is my child :) But I'm afraid I won't have the time to turn it
  into a really state of the art FD solver in the next times. It's
  just too much work ATM.

  But I'd like to say I think the solver is reasonably clean and could
  be a good starting point if any other person is interested in FD
  constraint programming. IMVHO it almost could be a Sistemas
  Informáticos/TFC topic such as "Advanced FD constraint solving". As
  I've already said, for me working in this has been a great learning
  experience. :)
*** Message to Elvira and Micky
The solver is written in Prolog and has two parts:

- Indexicals: Basically is finished, but some important optimizations
  are missing. (more on that below)

- High-level FD-constraints to indexicals compilation: It is in early
  stages of development. It works, but more work is needed to achieve a
  good translation. Also the indexicals library should grow.

IMHO before working in the last part, integration with Ciao should be
addressed (this is where I got stuck). Issues:

- When I tried to integrate the library the build system was quite
  unstable and I couldn't get clpfd to build with Ciao.

- I couldn't make lpdoc work for me, so (end-user) documentation is
  mostly missing. The code however should be reasonably commented.

- "src" type installation was not working for me (again unstable build
  system back then) so I couldn't play with the C engine.

I believe all the build system and libraries issues a fixed now, so
integrating it should not be very troublesome.

- There's an additional problem with Ciao, licensing information is not
  clear enough (most file are missing the GPL header/copyright and so
  on) In this state Ciao is not distributable by Ubuntu/Debian.

Once the library is living in contrib/ there are two main lines of work:

- Optimize the indexicals engine: The main problem is we cannot
  timestamp ground terms in a "transparent" way. Attributed terms would
  be wonderful for this, and would result in a *very fast*
  pure-in-Prolog indexical engine. Other issue is indexical wakeup, I'm
  pretty much sure we can speed this a lot using some special version
  for call/1. (All indexicals are immutable and known at compile time)

  After that, the main "bottleneck" would be range representation. If we
  had a bit-manipulation library we could implement a fast bit-vector
  version. Going to C we can use liboil (uses the FP engine of the
  processors). this gives us 2048-bit ranges, and all the
  operations are "free".

- Optimize the FD to idx translation. This is the place where static
  analysis should be hooked. IMHO the translator should perform the
  basic checks and let the rest to an specialized tool. I don't know a
  lot about CiaoPP, but I recall some papers for AI of FD programs.

- Labeling algorithms: I didn't research a lot here. The library
  supports FF and seq. It seems some advanced algorithms are difficult
  to code in pure Prolog.
