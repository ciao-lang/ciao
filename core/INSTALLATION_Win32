INSTALLATION_CIAO_Win32
***********************

This describes the installation of Ciao after downloading the Windows
binary (i.e., precompiled) distribution. It includes the installation
of libraries and manuals and applies to Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP
systems. This is the simplest Windows installation, since it requires
no compilation and is highly recommended. However, it is also possible
to compile Ciao from the source distribution on these systems (please
refer to *Note Installing Ciao from the source distribution:: for
details).

If you find any problems during installation, please refer to *Note
Troubleshooting (nasty messages and nifty workarounds)::.  See also
*Note Downloading new versions:: and *Note Reporting bugs::.

Win32 binary installation summary
=================================

Please follow these steps (below we use the terms folder and directory
interchangeably):

  1. Download the precompiled distribution and unpack it into any
     suitable folder, such as, e.g., `C:\Program Files'.

     This will create there a folder whose name reflects the Ciao
     version. Due to limitations of Windows related to file
     associations, do not put Ciao too deep in the folder hierarchy.
     For unpacking you will need a recent version of a zip archive
     manager - there are many freely available such as `WinZip',
     `unzip', `pkunzip', etc. (see for example `www.winzip.com'). Some
     users have reported some problems with version 6.2 of WinZip, but
     no problems with, e.g., version 7. With WinZip, simply click on
     "Extract" and select the extraction folder as indicated above.

  2. Stop any Ciao-related applications.

     If you have a previous version of Ciao installed, make sure you do
     not have any Ciao applications (including, e.g., a toplevel shell)
     running, or the extraction process may not be able to complete.
     You may also want to delete the entire folder of the previous
     installation to save space.

  3. Open the Ciao source directory created during extraction and run
     (e.g. by double-clicking on it) the `install'(`.bat') script.
     Answer "yes" to the dialog that pops up and type any character in
     the installation window to finish the process. You may need to
     reboot for the changes in the registry to take effect.

     This will update the windows registry (the file `ciao'(`.reg')
     lists the additions) and also create some `.bat' files which may
     be useful for running Ciao executables from the command line. It
     also creates initialization scripts for the `emacs' editor. The
     actions performed by the installation script are reported in the
     installation window.

  4. You may want to add a windows shortcut  in a convenient place,
     such as the desktop, to `ciaosh.cpx', the standard interactive
     toplevel shell. It is located inside the `shell' folder (e.g.,
     click on the file `ciaosh.cpx' with the right mouse button and
     select the appropriate option, `Send to->Desktop as shortcut').

  5. You may also want to add another shortcut to the file
     `ciao'(`.html') located inside `doc\reference\ciao_html' so that
     you can open the Ciao manual by simply double-clicking on this
     shortcut.

  6. Finally, if the (freely available) `emacs' editor/environment is
     not installed in your system, we highly recommend that you also
     install it at this point. While it is easy to use Ciao with any
     editor of your choice, the Ciao distribution includes a very
     powerful  application development environment which is based on
     `emacs' and which enables, e.g., source-level debugging, syntax
     coloring, context-sensitive on-line help, etc. If you are not
     convinced, consider that many programmers inside Micros*ft use
     `emacs' for developing their programs.

     Official relases for the latest `emacs' versions can be downloaded
     from `https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/#Obtaining' (See the
     `gnu/emacs' and `gnu/windows/emacs' directories in FTP mirrors).
     You can find answers to frequently asked questions (FAQ) about
     `emacs' in general at
     `http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/efaq.html' and about the
     Windows version at
     `http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/efaq-w32.html'.

     You need to tell `emacs' how to load the Ciao mode automatically
     when editing and how to access the on-line documentation:

        * Start `emacs' (double click on the icon or from the `Start'
          menu). Open (menu `Files->Open File' or simply <^X><^F>) the
          file `ForEmacs.txt' that the installation script has created
          in directory where you installed the Ciao distribution.

        * Copy the lines in the file (select with the mouse and then
          menu `Edit->Copy'). Open/Create using `emacs' (menu
          `Files->Open File' or simply <^X><^F>) the file `~/.emacs'
          (or, if this fails, `c:/.emacs').

        * Paste the two lines (menu `Edit->Paste' or simply <^Y>) into
          the file and save (menu `Files->Save Buffer' or simply
          <^X><^S>).

        * Exit `emacs' and start it again.


     `emacs' should not report any errors (at least related to Ciao) on
     startup. At this point the `emacs' checks in the following section
     should work.


Checking for correct installation on Win32
==========================================

After the actions and registry changes performed by the installation
procedure, you should check that the following should work correctly:

   * Ciao-related file types (`.pl' source files, `.cpx' executables,
     `.itf,.po,.asr' interface files, `.pls' scripts, etc.) should have
     specific icons associated with them (you can look at the files in
     the folders in the Ciao distribution to check).

   * Double-clicking on the shortcut to `ciaosh'(`.cpx') on the desktop
     should start the typical Prolog-style top-level shell in a window.
     If this shortcut has not been created on the desktop, then
     double-clicking on the `ciaosh'(`.cpx') icon inside the `shell'
     folder within the Ciao source folder should have the same effect.

   * In the top-level shell, Ciao library modules should load
     correctly. Type for example `use_module(library(dec10_io)).' at
     the Ciao top-level prompt -you should get back a prompt with no
     errors reported.

   * To exit the top level shell, type `halt.' as usual, or <^D>.


Also, the following documentation-related actions should work:

   * Double-clicking on the shortcut to `ciao'(`.html') which appears
     on the desktop should show the Ciao manual in your default WWW
     browser. If this shortcut has not been created you can
     double-click on the `ciao'(`.html') file in the
     `doc\reference\ciao_html' folder inside the Ciao source folder.

   * The `doc\reference' folder contains the manual also in the other
     formats present in the distribution, such as `info' (very
     convenient for users of the `emacs' editor/program development
     system) and `pdf'.


Finally, if `emacs' is installed, after starting it (double-clicking on
the `emacs' icon or from the `Start' menu) the following should work:

   * Typing <^H> <i> (or in the menus `Help->Manuals->Browse Manuals
     with Info') should open a list of manuals in info format in which
     the Ciao manual(s) should appear.

   * When opening a Ciao file, i.e., a file with `.pl' or `.pls'
     ending, using <^X><^F>`filename' (or using the menus) the code
     should appear highlighted according to syntax (e.g., comments in
     red), and `Ciao/Prolog' menus should appear in the menu bar on top
     of the `emacs' window.

   * Loading the file using the `Ciao/Prolog' menu (or typing <^C> <l>)
     should start in another emacs buffer the Ciao toplevel shell and
     load the file. You should now be able to switch the the toplevel
     shell and make queries from within `emacs'.


Note: when using `emacs' it is very convenient to swap the locations of
the (normally not very useful) <Caps Lock> key and the (very useful in
`emacs') <Ctrl> key on the keyboard. How to do this is explained in the
`emacs' frequently asked questions FAQs (see the `emacs' download
instructions for their location).

If you find that everything works but `emacs' cannot start the Ciao
toplevel you may want to check if you can open a normal Windows shell
within `emacs' (just do <M-x> `shell'). If you cannot, it is possible
that you are using some anti-virus software which is causing problems.
See `http://www.gnu.org/software/emac/windows/faq3.html#anti-virus' for
a workaround.

In some Windows versions it is possible that you had to change the
first backslashes in the ciao-mode-init.el file in the Ciao Directory.
E.g., assuming you have installed in drive `c:', instances of `c:\'
need to be changed to `c:/'. For example:
`c:\prolog/ciao-1.7p30Win32/shell/ciaosh.bat' should be changed to
`c:/prolog/ciao-1.7p30Win32/shell/ciaosh.bat'.

Compiling the miscellaneous utilities under Windows
===================================================

The `cmds' folder contains a number of utilities, documented in the
manual in PART V - Miscellaneous Standalone Utilities. In the Win32
distribution these utilities are not compiled by the installation
process. You can create the executable for each of them when needed by
compiling the corresponding `.pl' file.

Server installation under Windows
=================================

If you would like to install Ciao on a server machine, used by several
clients, the following steps are recommended:

   * Follow the standard installation procedure on the server. When
     selecting the folder in which Ciao is installed make sure you
     select a folder that is visible by the client machines. Also make
     sure that the functionality specified in the previous sections is
     now available on the server.

   * Perform a client installation on each client, by running (e.g.,
     double-click on it) the `client.bat' script. This should update
     the registry of each client. At this point all the functionality
     should also be available on the clients.


CGI execution under IIS
=======================

The standard installation procedure updates the windows registry so
that Ciao executables (ending in `.cpx') are directly executable as
CGIs under Microsoft's IIS, i.e., so that you make applications written
in Ciao available on the WWW (see the `pillow' library for specific
support for this task). In the event you re-install IIS, you probably
would lose the entries in the registry which allow this. In that case,
processing the file `ciao.reg' produced during the installation (or
simply reinstalling Ciao) will add those entries again.

Uninstallation under Windows
============================

To uninstall Ciao under Windows, simply delete the directory in which
you put the Ciao distribution. If you also want to delete the registry
entries created by the Ciao installation (not strictly needed) this
must currently be done by hand. The installation leaves a list of these
entries in the file `ciao.reg' to aid in this task. Also, all the
register entries contain the word ciao. Thus, to delete all Ciao
entries, run the application `regedit' (for example, by selecting `Run'
from the Windows `Start' menu), search (<^F>) for ciao in all registry
entries (i.e., select all of `Keys', `Values', and `Data' in the
`Edit->Find' dialog), and delete each matching key (click on the left
window to find the matching key for each entry found).
