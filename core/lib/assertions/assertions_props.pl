:- doc(head_pattern/1,"A @concept{head pattern} can be a predicate
   name (functor/arity) (@pred{predname/1}) or a term. Thus, both
   @tt{p/3} and @tt{p(A,B,C)} are valid head patterns. In the case in
   which the head pattern is a term, each argument of such a term can
   be:

   @begin{itemize} 

   @item A variable. This is useful in order to be able to refer to
   the corresponding argument positions by name within properties and
   in comments. Thus, @tt{p(Input,Parameter,Output)} is a valid head
   pattern.

   @item A variable, as above, but preceded by a ``@concept{mode}.''
   This mode determines in a compact way certain call or answer
   properties. For example, the head pattern
   @tt{p(Input,+Parameter,Output)} is valid, as long as @pred{+/1} is
   declared as a mode.

   Some useful mode definitions can be found in the @lib{basicmodes}
   and @lib{isomodes} libraries.  Users can define modes using the
   @decl{modedef/1} declaration. @cindex{useful modes}

   @item Any term. In this case this term determines the instantiation
   state of the corresponding argument position of the predicate calls
   to which the assertion applies.

   @item A ground term preceded by a ``@concept{mode}.'' The ground
   term determines a property of the corresponding argument. The mode
   determines if it applies to the calls and/or the successes.
   The actual property referred to is
   that given by the term but with one more argument added at the
   beginning, which is a new variable which, in a rewriting of the
   head pattern, appears at the argument position occupied by the term.
   For example, the head pattern @tt{p(Input,+list(int),Output)} is
   valid for mode @pred{+/1} defined in @lib{library(isomodes)}, and
   equivalent in this case to having the head pattern
   @tt{p(Input,A,Output)} and stating that the property
   @tt{list(int,A)} holds for the calls of the  predicate.

   @item Any term preceded by a ``@concept{mode}.'' In this case, only
   one variable is admitted, it has to be the first argument of the mode,
   and it represents the argument position.
   I.e., it plays the role of the new variable mentioned above. Thus,
   no rewriting of the head pattern is performed in this case.
   For example, the head pattern @tt{p(Input,+(Parameter,list(int)),Output)}
   is valid for mode @pred{+/2} defined in @lib{library(isomodes)}, and
   equivalent in this case to having the head pattern
   @tt{p(Input,Parameter,Output)} and stating that the property
   @tt{list(int,Parameter)} holds for the calls of the  predicate.
