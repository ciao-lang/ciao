Version/Change Log
==================

Version 3.0 (2011/7/7, 16:33:15 CEST)
        * Major redesign of the documentation generator:
             * LPdoc redesigned to work internally with a 'doctree'
               representation (a-la Pillow). (Jose Morales)

             * A native HTML backend (not generated from texi). (Jose
               Morales)

             * Allow custom website generation from LPdoc documents.
               (Jose Morales)

             * Two passes for document generation, allowing resolution
               of bibliographical references in all backends (including
               HTML). (Jose Morales)

             * `doc_structure/1' in `SETTINGS' allows structure in
               LPdoc documents (sections can really be nested inside
               parts). (Jose Morales)

             * `:- doc(_,_)' is the recommended syntax for
               documentation comments now.

             * Replacing `:- comment' by `:- doc' in LPdoc code,
               updated documentation. (Jose Morales)

        * General improvements and bug fixes:
             * Designed a logo for LPdoc. (Jose Morales)

             * LPdoc comments can now be written using `%!' style
               comment syntax. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

             * Now commas etc. are allowed in section names (so that
               they can be used in other formats). They are eliminated
               automatically in texi and info. This avoids wrong
               section names -and thus dangling pointers- in generated
               texinfo files. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

             * Eliminated superfluous copy of summary in info mode.
               (Manuel Hermenegildo)

             * Eliminated unsupported chars that broke texi manual
               cross-referencing. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

             * Improved treatment of accents (dotless i and dotless j,
               o, etc.). (Manuel Hermenegildo)

             * Initial size passed to `xdvi' more appropriate for
               current `xdvis'. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

             * Accents in bibliography fixed. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

             * Now repeated sections are disambiguated. (Manuel
               Hermenegildo)

             * Eliminated unnecessary escaping (especially for &).
               (Manuel Hermenegildo)

             * Better detection of when version is not available.
               (Manuel Hermenegildo)

             * Added new `doc(address, _)' comment, which is the right
               place to put address/contact information in manuals
               (Jose Morales)

             * Added new `@version{}' command (expands to the version
               of the software to be documented). (Jose Morales)

             * Shorter `SETTINGS.pl' files (with some rudimentary,
               assertion-based checking of options) (Jose Morales)

             * Bug fix: '`@@ include'' and '`@@ includeverbatim'' are
               no longer a problem (space can be omitted) (Jose Morales)

             * Added and documented a new `documentation' filetype (for
               some parts of the manual that contains only
               documentation). That avoids the old trick of declaring a
               fake `main/0' predicate. (Jose Morales)

             * Style for subtitle added automatically (in texinfo, it
               is emph; in HTML it is normal text with smaller font).
               The entries in `subtitle_extra' are free-form. (Jose
               Morales)

             * Bugs and changelog appear now in the global links in the
               HTML backend. (Jose Morales)

             * Merged code that documented `.pl' and `.lpdoc' files.
               (Jose Morales)

             * No copyright section if no copyright comment. (Jose
               Morales)

             * Auxiliary documentation files ending in '`_doc''
               displayed incorrect names for the module (ending in
               '`_doc''). E.g., `use_package(foo_doc)' was displayed
               instead of `use_package(foo_doc)'. Fixed. (Jose Morales)

             * In `verbatim' enviroments, new-line characters are
               removed from the beginning. (Jose Morales)

             * Fix wrong use of `erase/1' for clauses (which resulted
               in segmentation fault when documentation generation
               failed) (Jose Morales)

             * Fixed image generation (now uses `.png' files for HTML)
               (Jose Morales)

             * New code for text escape fixed some problems, like
               '`@/1'' operator not being displayed corretly in Info.
               (Jose Morales)

             * Colors for Prolog variables (in HTML). (Jose Morales)

             * Added `@begin{alert}' environment for alert messages
               (like cartouche, but in red). (Jose Morales)

             * Supporting '@"' command for umlaut, in addition to '@..'
               (Jose Morales)

             * Double quotes correctly translated to HTML (Jose Morales)

             * `@author' command to reference authors (changed command
               referring to people by `@author', in all the
               documentation) (Jose Morales)

             * Simplification of documentation setting files (see the
               documentation for further details) (Jose Morales)

             * Using `open' for `lpdoc htmlview' command in MacOS X
               (Jose Morales)

             * Adding `html' and `pdf' formats as options for emacs
               customization of LPdoc (`html' is the default one now)
               (Jose Morales)

             * Improved detection of external tools for image
               conversion. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

             * Added section name syntax auto-correction. This avoids
               wrong section names -and thus dangling pointers- in
               generated texinfo files. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

             * Document size more appropriate for current xdvi
               versions. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

             * Lpdoc no longer adds .info filename suffix to .infoindex
               entries since it breaks Debian's install-info -remove
               and goes against standard practice anyway. (Jose Luis
               Gonzalez)

             * Added option -cv, -comment-version, that tells lpdoc if
               the file has version comment. Formatting of lpdoc
               version comments completed. (Edison Mera)

             * Improved handling of option values. Added -d option to
               lpdoc, that allows defining additional values in the
               argument. Added options -l and -m that are similar to
               the corresponding lpmake options. (Edison Mera)

        * Support for in-code sections (experimental):
             * Latex-like font-lock highlight of sectioning
               documentation comments (`:- doc(C, "...")', with `C' one
               of `title', `section', and `subsection').

               Currently the `section' and `subsection' comments are
               still ignored by LPdoc. (Jose Morales)

        * Support for mathematical notation (experimental):
             * new @math{...} and
               @begin{displaymath}...@end{displaymath} enviroments are
               supported (see the documentation for more details) (Jose
               Morales)

             * In documentation strings, single `\' must be escaped
               (e.g. '@math{\\lambda}') (Jose Morales)

             * Supported in both the texinfo and HTML (using MathJax)
               backends. (Jose Morales)

             * Added `@defmathcmd{Cmd}{N}{Def}' and
               `@defmathcmd{Cmd}{Def}', both for texinfo and HTML
               backends. Those LPdoc commands define new mathematical
               environments (equivalent to `\newcommand'). (Jose
               Morales)

Version 2.1 (2004/10/28, 16:38:17 CEST)
     Last version before moving to subversion. 1.9 and 2.0 were merged.
     1.9 (based on makefiles) is deprecated.

        * New functionality:

               `comment') now allowed. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

             * Made xdvi viewer, ps viewer, and xdvi zoom size be
               paramenters (the latter since new versions of xdvi
               display sizes differently than old ones). (Manuel
               Hermenegildo)

             * Processing options can now be set for each file
               independently. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

               ConfigFile instead the default LPSETTINGS.pl. (Edison
               Mera)

             * Added option ascii that generates documentation in ascii
               plain format. (Edison Mera)

             * Added -help option. Is equal to -h. (Edison Mera)

             * Added option testsettings to check that the settings
               file is correctly specified. (Edison Mera)

             * Changed `generate_html_pointer/5' by

     Hermenegildo)

Version 1.9#8 (1999/11/7, 13:45:44 MET)

               supported.

             * @foonote command now supported.

             * New `gmake htmlview' command (makes a running `netscape'
               visit the generated html manual). Suggested by Per
               Cederberg.

             * New `gmake distclean' command, intended for software
               distributions. Leaves the generated documents and
               eliminates all intermediate files (including
               `.texic'/`.texi' files).

             * Adobe `pdf' format now supported as a valid target.
               Unfortunately, embedded `.eps' figures are not supported
               at this time in pdf output.

             * The second argument of `:- comment(hide,...).' and `:-
               comment(doinclude,...).' declarations can now be a list
               of predicate names.

             * A `-u' File option is now supported so that a file
               including, e.g., path alias definitions can be included
               (this has the same functionality as the `-u' option in
               `ciaoc').

             * Now typing just `gmake' does nothing. In order to do
               something at least one target should be specified. This
               was necessary so that recursive invocations with empty
               arguments did nothing.

             * Added a new filetype: `part'. This allows splitting
               large documents into parts, each of which groups a
               series of chapters.

        * Other new functionality:
             * A style sheet can now be specified which allows
               modifying many characteristics of the html output
               (fonts, colors, background, ...) (thanks to Per
               Cederberg).

             * Added limited support for changing page numbering (in
               `SETTINGS' file).

             * The concept indexing commands (@index, @cindex, and
               @concept) now work somewhat differently, to make them
               consistent with other indexing commands.

             * The old usage index is now called, more appropriately,
               global index. Correspondingly, changed things so that
               now every definition goes to the global index in
               addition to its definitional index.

             * Imported files from module `user' are now documented
               separately.

             * Now a warning is issued if characters unsupported by
               info are used in section names.

             * Navigation in html docs was improved.

             * The table of contents in printed manuals now contains
               entries for the individual descriptions of predicates,
               props, regtypes, declarations, etc. This can be shut off
               with the `-shorttoc' option.

             * Made more silent in normal conditions: file inclusion is
               muted now unless `-v' option is selected.

             * A single `.texi' file is now constructed (by grouping
               the `.texic' files generated for all components) in
               which the references and menus are resolved. This has
               the advantage that the process of resolving references
               and menus has now been sped up very significantly. Also,
               `texi' is now a valid target (perhaps useful for
               distributions). The generated files now have `texic'
               (texinfo component).

             * Now, declarations are always documented as long as there
               is a `decl' assertion. Also, they are now documented in
               a separate section.

        * Bug fixes and other minor improvements:
             * The directory containing html manual is now called
               BASENAME`_html' instead of just BASENAME, which was
               confusing.

             * Now requesting building a .ps only does not leave a .dvi
               behind (useful for distributions).

             * File names can now include the symbol `_' even if they
               contain figures.

             * `TeX'-related intermediate files are now cleaned up
               after each run in order to avoid clutter.

             * Fixed `-modes', which was broken since going to the new
               normalizer (was normalizer problem). Fixed problem with
               no documentation when only modes given.

             * Fixed duplication of documentation for internal
               predicates when also exported.

             * Minor formatting problem when no documentation nor
               definition found for a regtype fixed.

             * Determining exports, imports, etc. now done solely by
               calls to `c_itf' library (and, thus, synchronized with
               `ciaoc' compiler).

Version 1.8#42 (1999/6/30, 14:2:12 MEST)
     Changed texi2html to generate better HTML with attributes for

Version 1.8#41 (1999/6/22, 19:33:51 MEST)
     Added `gmake htmlview' command (makes a running `netscape' visit
     the generated html manual). Suggested by Per Cederberg. (Manuel
     Hermenegildo)

Version 1.8#40 (1999/6/17, 20:6:0 MEST)
     File names can now include the symbol `_' even if they contain
     figures (fixes a reported bug). (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.8#39 (1999/6/10, 13:16:43 MEST)
     Added default style sheet for html and introduced conditional
     copying. (Per Cederberg)

Version 1.8#38 (1999/6/9, 19:34:10 MEST)
     Now using style sheets for html output. (Per Cederberg)

Version 1.8#36 (1999/5/27, 17:5:4 MEST)
     Directory containing html manual is now called BASENAME`_html'
     instead of just BASENAME, which was confusing. (Manuel
     Hermenegildo)

Version 1.8#28 (1999/4/21, 10:40:55 CEST)
     Eliminated unnecessary loading of iso_byte_char and dcg_expansion.
     (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.8#23 (1999/4/8, 14:53:34 MEST)
     A `-u' File option is now supported so that a file including path
     alias definitions can be included (this has the same functionality
     as the `-u' option in `ciaoc'). (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.8#22 (1999/4/8, 1:23:48 MEST)
     A background can now be specified for the `html' manuals (needs a
     modified version of `texi2html' included with the `lpdoc'
     library). (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.8#21 (1999/4/7, 23:19:33 MEST)
     `TeX'-related intermediate files are now cleaned up after each run
     in order to avoid clutter. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.8#20 (1999/4/7, 21:11:14 MEST)
     Adobe `pdf' format now supported as a valid target. Unfortunately,
     embedded `.eps' figures are not supported at this time in pdf
     output. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.8#19 (1999/4/7, 21:6:55 MEST)
     A single `.texi' file is now constructed (by grouping the `.texic'
     files generated for all components) in which the references and
     menus are resolved. This has the advantage that the process of
     resolving references and menus has now been sped up very
     significantly. Also, `texi' is now a valid target (perhaps useful
     for distributions). (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.8#17 (1999/4/5, 23:24:4 MEST)
     Now requesting building a .ps only does not leave a .dvi behind
     (useful for distributions). (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.8#3 (1999/3/26, 20:0:47 MET)
     Changed `Makefile.skel' so that now typing just `gmake' does
     nothing. In order to do something at least one target should be
     specified. This was necessary so that recursive invocations with
     empty arguments did nothing. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.8#1 (1999/3/25, 10:12:49 MET)
     New `gmake distclean', intended for software distributions. Leaves
     the generated documents and eliminates all intermediate files
     (including `.texi' files). (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.8 (1999/3/24, 21:15:33 MET)
     This version completes the port to using the ciao 0.8 modular
     assertion processing library. In addition, it includes the
     following improvements:

        * Now, if the name of a file being documented ends in `_doc',
          the `_doc' part is left out when referring to the file in the
          documentation (useful if one would like to place the
          documentation declarations in different file).

        * It is now possible to declare (via a `comment/2' declaration)
          the intended use of a file which is not a module (i.e. a
          package, user, or include file), which results in correct
          documentation of operator definitions, new declarations, etc.
          The declaration is only needed for 'user' files (i.e., files
          to be loaded with `ensure_loaded/1').

        * Separated generation of the manuals from their installation.
          I.e., `gmake install' now does not force a `gmake all', which
          has to be done by hand. This was necessary to ensure correct
          installation of distributed manuals, even if modification
          dates are changed during installation. Previously, in some
          cases generation was triggered unnecessarily.

        * New `-v' option allows using quieter by default operation
          when not debugging.

        * New option `-propmods' makes the name of the module in which
          a property is defined appear in front of the property in the
          places where the property is used.

        * New option `-noisoline' makes the textual explanation of the
          `iso/1' property not appear in the description of the usage
          (but the < * ISO * >symbol does appear)

        * Two new options, `-nosysmods' and `-noengmods', selectively
          avoid listing the system or engine libraries used.

        * If there is no declaration for a predicate, now a line is
          output with the name and arity and a simple comment saying
          that there is no further documentation available (this has
          the great advantage that then it goes in the index, and, for
          example in ciao, they get added to completion commands!).

        * Now, if a property or regtype declaration has no textual
          comment, the actual definition is given (first level only) in
          the place where it is documented, and a simple generic
          message where it is used.

        * Added @noindent and @iso commands.

        * Nicer spacing now when printing predicate names which are
          operators, as well as modes, etc.

        * Reporting of versions in libraries has been improved: now
          both the global version and the last version in which the
          library itself was changed are reported.

        * Exported new declarations also documented now for
          include-type files.

        * A module is now documented even if exports nothing at all.

        * Engine modules used now documented even if no other modules
          used (was a reported bug).

        * Fixed indexing of names containing @ etc. for newer versions
          of texinfo.

        * Tabs in verbatim modes now converted to a number of spaces
          (8). Not perfect, but produces better output than leaving the
          tabs in.

        * Tex is now run in 'nonstopmode' which means it will typically
          not stop if there are minor errors (but some errors may go
          unnoticed...).

        * The full path of the version maintenance directory is now
          computed (correctly) using the directory of the `.pl' file
          being documented as base.

        * Notices for missing subtitle, copyright, and summary now only
          given from main file and not for components.

        * Added special handling of regtype and generalized it to
          handle some props specially if there is a certain comp
          property present.

     (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.7#34 (1999/3/22, 16:53:3 CET)
     In `Makefile.skel', separated generation of the manuals from their
     installation. I.e., `gmake install' now does not force a `gmake
     all', which has to be done by hand. This was necessary to ensure
     correct installation of distributed manuals, even if modification
     dates are changed during installation. Previously, in some cases
     generation was triggered unnecessarily. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.7#14 (1999/3/1, 11:3:24 MET)
     Minor fix to dependencies in Makefile. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.7 (1998/12/2, 17:43:50 MET)
     Major port to use the ciao 0.8 modular assertion processing
     library. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.6#9 (1998/9/16, 12:14:1 MEST)
     Added `DOTcshrc' files to library. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.6#8 (1998/9/16, 12:13:31 MEST)
     Updated documentation. Separated intro stuff into chapters: more
     logical, faster compilation. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.6#7 (1998/9/15, 19:17:53 MEST)
     Nicely formatted `README' and `INSTALL' files now generated
     automatically on installation. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.6#4 (1998/9/11, 10:28:34 MEST)
     Trouble shooting section added to documentation. (Manuel
     Hermenegildo)

Version 1.6 (1998/9/8, 12:49:26 MEST)
     Added support for inserting images (.eps files) in text via @image
     command, email addresses via @email command, and url references
     via @uref command.

     Unix 'man' output much improved. Also, it now includes a usage
     section. The correspoding text must be given in a string contained
     in the first argument of a fact of the `usage_message/1' predicate
     which appears in the program. Also, formatting of 'man' pages has
     been greatly improved.

     A new 'ascii' format is now supported: a simple minded ascii
     manual (basically, an info file without pointers).

     (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.5#6 (1998/8/31, 13:52:36 MET DST)
     `Makefile' can now use printf instead of echo for portability
     (unfortunately, different versions of echo behave very
     differently). (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.5 (1998/8/23, 20:30:32 EST)
     Now supporting a @cite command (YES!). It automatically accesses
     the bib entries in `.bib' files (using `bibtex') and produces a
     'References' appendix. @cite can be used in the text strings
     exactly as \cite in LaTeX. The set of bib files to be used is
     given in the `SETTINGS' file.

     Defining the type of version maintenance that should be performed
     by the `emacs' ciao.el mode (i.e., whether version numbers are in
     a given directory or in the file itself) is controlled now via a
     standard `commment/2' declaration. You should now write a
     declaration such as:

     `:- comment(version_maintenance,dir('../version')).'

     to state that control info is kept in directory `../version'. This
     has the advantage that it is shorter than the previous solution
     and that lpdoc can read this info easily. Using this guarantees
     that the version numbers of the manuals always concide with those
     of the software.

     Generation of indices of manuals (.htmlbullet files): if several
     manuals are installed in the same directory, an index to them is
     now generated at the beginning of the html cover page describing
     the directory.

     (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.4#5 (1998/8/14, 9:22:6 MET DST)
     More improvements to `Makefile'. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.4#3 (1998/8/7, 14:27:20 MET DST)
     Several changes in `Makefile' (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.4 (1998/8/4, 19:10:35 MET DST)
     The set of paths defined in `SETTINGS' for finding the source
     files are now also used to find 'included' files. As a result,
     full path is not needed any more in, e.g, @include command.

     New @ref command which can be used to refer to chapeter, sections,
     subsections, etc..

     Support for recent minor changes in assertion format, including
     '#' as comment separator.

     Used modules are now separated in documentation (in the interface
     description) by type (user, system, engine...).

     Supports new 'hide' option in comments, to prevent an exported
     predicate from being documented. This is useful for example for
     avoiding mentioning in the documentation multifile predicates
     which are not intended to be modified by the user.

     (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.3#2 (1998/7/10, 20:42:12 MET DST)
     Added overall handling of -s option - separating system and user
     libraries. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.3 (1998/7/10, 16:35:2 MET DST)
     Exports are now listed in the chapter header separated by kind
     (pred, types, properties, ...).

     The list of other modules used by a module is now separated in the
     chapter header into User and System modules (controlled by two
     sets of paths in `SETTINGS').

     New hide option of comment/2 decl prevents an exported predicate
     from being included in the documentation: `:- comment(hide,p/3)'.

     (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.2#1 (1998/6/10, 10:15:28 MET DST)
     More improvements to documentation. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.2 (1998/6/4, 9:12:19 MET DST)
     Major overall improvements... (Manuel Hermenegildo)

     Improved makefiles (no explicit calls to gmake). (Manuel
     Hermenegildo)

Version 1.1#8 (1998/4/9)
     Enhanced documentation. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.1#3 (1998/4/7)
     Fixed document makefile so that no formatting is repeated (by
     creating .ltxi files). (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.1#2 (1998/4/6)
     Replaced atom_chars/2 with atom_codes/2 (to make code more
     compatible with older Prologs). (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.1#1 (1998/4/3)
     Added treatment of `comment' command. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.1 (1998/3/31)
     Incorporated autodoc and autodoformats library to source in order
     to make distribution standalone. Improvements to installation and
     documentation. `Makefile's now also install documentation in
     public areas and produce global indices. Several documents can
     cohexist in the same installation directory. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.0#6 (1998/3/30)
     Improved installation. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

     deinstallation. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 1.0 (1998/2/24)
     First Ciao-native distribution, with installation. (Manuel
     Hermenegildo)

Version 0.9#1 (1998/2/24)
     File version is now global lpdoc version. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 0.9 (1998/2/24)
     Intermediate version, preparing for first major release. Modified
     `Makefile' and `SETTINGS' to handle installation of manuals.
     (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 0.6#1 (1998/2/20)
     Modified `Makefile' and `SETTINGS' to handle installation of
     manuals. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 0.6 (1998/2/10)
     Added new indices and options, as well as more orthogonal handling
     of files. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 0.4 (1998/2/24)
     Added support for nroff -m formatting (e.g., for man pages). Added
     support for optional selection of indices to be generated. Added
     support for reexported predicates. Added (low level) ascii format.
     Added option handling (-nobugs -noauthors -noversion -nochangelog
     -nopatches -modes and -headprops ...). -literalprops. Fixed
     presentation when there are multiple kinds of assertions. Better
     error checking for includefact/includedef. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 0.3 (1998/2/10)
     Changed file reader to use Ciao native builtins. As a result,
     syntax files and full Ciao syntax now supported. Major
     reorganization of the code to make formatting more orthogonal. Now
     applications and libraries can be components or main files,
     standalone or with components interchangeably. @includefact, new
     predicate types, used libraries now precisely detected,
     `docinclude' option. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 0.2#1 (1998/1/26)
     Changed file reader to use Ciao native builtins. As a result,
     syntax files and full Ciao syntax now supported. (Manuel
     Hermenegildo)

Version 0.2 (1997/12/16)
     Ported to native ciao. Version handling, selection of indices,
     @include. Added generation of an html brief description for a
     global index. Added unix manual page generation. Added support for
     specifying library paths. -l option for htmlindex and man.
     Installation improved: now all files for one application in the
     same directory. (Manuel Hermenegildo)

Version 0.1#9 (1997/11/10)
     Added handling of -l option for htmlindex and man. (Manuel
     Hermenegildo)

Version 0.1#8 (1997/9/19)
     Changed argument parsing to use DCGs - much nicer! (Manuel
     Hermenegildo)
