This is the beginning of a top-level info node.

File: dir	Node: Top	This is the top of the INFO tree

  This (the Directory node) gives a menu of major topics. 
  Typing "q" exits, "?" lists all Info commands, "d" returns here,
  "h" gives a primer for first-timers,
  "mEmacs<Return>" visits the Emacs topic, etc.

  In Emacs, you can click mouse button 2 on a menu item or cross reference
  to select it.
