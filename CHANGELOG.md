   function.
 - FIX: limit internal buffer in `copy_file` (workaround EMSCRIPTEN issue)
 - CHANGED: Removed NECK_PROCEED profile trace hook

   syntax highlight).
 - CHANGED: Format buffer key binding changed to `C-c C-f`
 - FIX: Fix bug in `ciao-show-inferior-process`, minor simplifications.
 - FIX: Support for `_doc.pl` files for info and ascii output (lpdoc
   correctly eliminates `_doc` in output but Emacs still tried to open
   `_doc.info`, `_doc_ascii`, etc.).

 - ADDED: Replaced `using_tty/0` with `system_extra:istty/1`
   (specify fd).
 - ADDED: cgoal/1 property (to distinguish from callable/1 ISO
   pred).
 - ADDED: `binexec` option for automatic spawning of active
   modules. This produces multi-purpose binaries that can start
   as either normal processes or active modules.
 - ADDED: Added `ivar/1` meta-property in assertions
   (expands to `var/1` plus independence from all other vars).
 - ADDED: New rtchecks (run-time assertion checking) code for
   `det/1`, `semidet/1`, `multidet/1`, `nondet/1` 
   properties.
 - ADDED: Option to run unit tests in the same process.
 - ADDED: Custom headers in foreign interface gluecode (useful
   for custom type translations).

Ciao emacs mode:
 - ADDED: Distribute flycheck and company support for
   ciao-mode.
 - ADDED: New `ciao-emacs` command (start emacs with
   "batteries included"). It preinstalls markdown mode and
   contrib packages.
 - IMPROVED: library for navigating options menus (used in,
   e.g., CiaoPP): allow cursor navigation, eliminated need for
   OK/cancel buttons, allow integer values in responses.
 - CHANGED: Change check assertions binding to `C-c V`.
 - FIXED: `=>` is no longer a prompt recognised my ciao-emacs.
 - FIXED: Issue in passing of system-args to ciao process.  
 
## [1.20.0] - 2021-3-18 

Build system:
 - ADDED: Experimental `analyze` build grade for analyzing whole
   bundles (depends on CiaoPP).
 - FIXED: Fix activation links for `pkgconfig` files in
   3rd-party installation.
 - DEPRECATED: Removed support for 3rd-party `bower` package
   system (all existing uses ported to `npm`). 

Language, compiler, and toplevel:
 - FIXED: Fix a bug that redirected `main/1` calls from the
   toplevel to the `ciaosh` `main/1` predicate (accidentally via
   the `user` module).
 - FIXED: Detect wrong arity in `add_goal_trans` directives.
 - IMPROVED: Towards a more modular `native_props.pl`,
   documentation improvements.
 - IMPROVED: Progress towards merging optim-comp branch for native
   compilation.
 - IMPROVED: Refactored default language packages (they can be used
   from modules and toplevels).
 - CHANGED: `note` messages go to user error (like other
   compiler messages). 

Engine:
 - ADDED: Support for new Apple M1. This port is based on existing
   support for the aarch64 (ARM64) architecture. NOTE: some
   executable formats depend on redoing 'codesign' after the
   executable is linked (this may cause issues when distributing
   binaries). 

Runtime checks, testing, and debugging:
 - IMPROVED: `mshare/1` internally represented as
   `mshare/2`, with explicit relevant arguments (for
   `rtchecks`).
 - IMPROVED: Refactor pieces of embedded debugger.
 - IMPROVED: Note message for modules compiled with the trace
   or debug packages.
 - FIXED: Do not ignore assertions with empty compats, calls,
   success, and comps fields (also for `texec`).
 - FIXED: Improve debugging of modules with rtcheck instrumentation.
 - FIXED: Expansion for runtime checks preserve `?- ...` 
   directives. 

Libraries:
 - ADDED: Support for Unicode (UTF8) in source code:
   - Pre-generated character code classes for 0..127
   - Documented code class types and identifier syntax for Unicode
     source code (see `tokenize.pl`).
   - Very efficient and compact (8KB) code class table (see
     `unicode_gen.pl` for details). 
 - ADDED: Unicode escape \\uDDDD and \\UDDDDDDDD in strings and atoms.
 - ADDED: Added byte-oriented predicates (see `stream_utils.pl`) and
   types (`basic_props:bytelist/1`), using them when needed.
 - ADDED: Added string_bytes/2 predicate. This predicate bidirectionally
   transforms between lists of character codes and lists of bytes
   (using UTF8 encoding/decoding). It is equivalent to =/2 when at
   least one of the lists is already a list of ASCII codes (0..127).
 - ADDED: Stronger redirection predicates (`open_std_redirect/3` and
   `close_std_redirect/1`), which allow the redirection of the standard
   output/error file descriptors together with the default output
   stream, `user_output`, and `user_error`. Added `system:fd_dup/2` and
   `system:fd_close/1` predicates to manipulate POSIX file
   descriptors.
 - ADDED: Added `stream_utils:copy_stream/3` predicate (copies bytes from one
   stream to the other).
 - ADDED: Extended `io_once_port_reify/@{3,4@}` with better redirections
   (subset of process channels available for `process_call/3`).
 - ADDED: Parsing of version strings (`version_strings:version_parse/4`).
 - IMPROVED: Heuristics in `write_assertion/@{6,7@}`, more
   readable output.
 - IMPROVED: Allow JSON values (not only lists) as top argument for
   JSON write and parse.
 - IMPROVED: Faster and more reliable sockets predicates. New
   `socket_sendall/2`, `socket_send_stream/2`, changed
   `socket_send/3`. `socket_recv_code/3` is replaced by
   `socket_recv/3` (treating the returned length is encouraged, do
   not use `socket_recv/2`).
 - IMPROVED: Faster and more robust HTTP libraries (sockets improvements,
   faster IO). Several bug fixes.
 - FIXED: Fixed bug in markdown parser which confused some
   predicate heads with items.
 - FIXED: Allow numbers (as constants) in assertion head arguments.
 - FIXED: Fixed bug in `attrdump.pl` introduced when `assoc` replaced
   `dict`.
 - FIXED: Write blanks before -0.Nan if needed. Fixed some corner cases in
   parser for 0.Inf, 0.Nan .
 - FIXED: Cleanups in messages_basic:messages/1.
 - FIXED: Allow `use_package(tabling)` in a toplevel. 

ISO and Portability:
 - ADDED: Implemented `at_end_of_stream/0`,
   `at_end_of_stream/1`. Peek byte in `at_end_of_stream/@{0,1@}` for
   improved ISO compatibility.
 - ADDED: Implemented `peek_byte/1`, `peek_byte/2`.
 - ADDED: Added call_det/2 predicate (compatible with `gprolog`).
 - ADDED: Added forall/2 predicate (compatible with `gprolog`).
 - FIXED: callable/1 is an instantiation check.
 - IMPROVED: Added version_data flag as
   `ciao(Major,Minor,Patch,Extra)`.
 - IMPROVED: Added stream property `type(_)` in `open/4` 
   predicate (for compatibility).
 - ADDED: `--iso-strict` flag in `ciaoc` and `ciaosh` to enable
   stricter compatibility ISO mode by default. Use with care, switching the flag
   will not enforce the recompilation of already compiled user files
   and modules (i.e., .po files).
 - IMPROVED: Additions to the `iso_strict.pl` package (only for code
   using this package):
   - More compatible version of `absolute_file_name/2` (do not
     repeat last path component when resolving library paths).
   - Allow stream aliases in most IO operations.
   - Import `keysort/2` and `format/?` predicates by default.
   - Enable `call/N` by default.
   - Enable `runtime_ops` package by default.

Ciao emacs mode:
 - ADDED: Initial support for `flycheck`, integrating ciaoc,
   ciaopp, lpdoc, and testing.
 - ADDED: Support for company mode (text completion). Manuals
   are located dynamically. Completion list obtained using
   @lib{librowser}.
 - ADDED: Extended Ciao mode (`ciao-emacs-plus.el`) using
   `flycheck` and `company` extensions.
 - ADDED: `M-x ciao-server-start`, `M-x ciao-server-stop` 
   to start/stop the `ciao-serve` process (serving local HTML
   documentation and hub for HTTP based interface to active
   modules).
 - ADDED: Mark and color new `passed`, `failed`,
   `aborted` message types (for unit tests).
 - IMPROVED: Replace outdated `word-help` by
   `info-look`.
 - IMPROVED: Better binding for next error, better code
   highlight, narrow error location.
 - IMPROVED: Allow short location paths (resolved from the
   elisp side). See `bundle_paths:bundle_extend_path/2` for
   details on path extension.
 - IMPROVED: Faster font-lock in `ciao-inferior-mode`, only
   treat keywords.
 - FIXED: Fixed indentation and coloring of `=:=`.
 - FIXED: Fix build errors when compiling using emacs 27.1.

Unit Tests:
 - ADDED: Allow `opt_suff/1` in unit tests (for alternative
   source files, e.g., for flycheck).
 - ADDED: New options for handling tests for stdout and stderr
   in unittest.
 - ADDED: Added support for test filters (see options in
   `run_tests/4`).
 - ADDED: Using 'passed', 'failed', and 'aborted' message types.
 - ADDED: Test timeout.
 - ADDED: Initial support for integrated regression testing
   (see `save`, `compare`, etc. actions in `run_tests/3`).
 - IMPROVED: More flexible quering of results and statistics
   (`get_statistical_summary/2`, `print_statistical_summary/1`,
   `status(S)` option).
 - IMPROVED: Simpler one-line output per test.
 - IMPROVED: Warnings when predicate fails/throws and there were no
   failure/exception properties in test assertion.
 - FIXED: Unittest regression does not depend on Ciao root path.  
 
## [1.19.0] - 2020-3-20 

Highlights of this release:

 - Build system: optional (weak) dependencies in bundle
   Manifest, out-of-tree builds by default in bundles (sources are
   no longer polluted with .po/.itf files).
 - Language and libraries: a more natural argument order in
   partial applications, clarified semantics of shared variables in
   predicate abstractions (and faster implementation), improvements
   in tabling with constraints (TCLP).
 - System: several fixes in small and large integer operations,
   new algorithm for float to string conversion (based on Ryu,
   fixing the round-trip property), and thread-safe exception
   handling mechanism.
 - Runtime checks and unit tests: major cleanups, fixes, and
   improvements in functionality and efficiency.
 - Top level: cyclic terms detected by default (`check_cycles` 
   flag no longer needed), faster pretty printing of solutions.
 - Ciao emacs mode: 4-space indentation by default. Improvements
   to syntax coloring. Coloring of info manuals generated by
   LPdoc. Connection with ciao-serve. Dropped support for xemacs.
 - Installation: new instructions for Windows based on WSL and
   for Android based on Termux. 
 
Bellow is a detailed list of new features and changes.

Builder and installation:
 - ADDED: Optional (weak) dependencies in bundle
   Manifests. Weak dependencies allow bundles with conditional
   code which depends on the availability of other bundles.
 - ADDED: Allow gitlab aliases in `ciao get`, i.e.,
   `ciao get gitlab.x.y.z/some/path` will recognize (as a
   heuristic) that we are trying to install a bundle from a Gitlab
   repository. It should work for any instance of gitlab (as long
   as there is public access to the repository).
 - ADDED: Exposed `third-party-install` command (e.g.,
   `ciao third-party-install ciao_ppl.ppl` to install `ppl` 
   3rd-party from `ciao_ppl` bundle).
 - ADDED: Execute `autoreconf -i` when GNU build system is
   selected and the `configure` file is not available
   (3rd-party installer).
 - ADDED: Support for `zsh` shell, unified config in
   `--core:update_shell=[yes|no]` 
 - ENHANCED: Improved interactive `ciao-boot.sh` (reordered
   questions, check deps).
 - EXPERIMENTAL: Support for `--parallel=yes` build option.
 - FIXED: Throw exception if foreign config tool is not found.
 - FIXED: Absolute path in rpath for 3rd-party libs.
 - FIXED: Make sure that `cache/` dir exists before loading
   bundle manifest hooks.
 - FIXED: `ciao clean-tree` works with non-absolute paths.
 - FIXED: Do not assume `/bin/rm` is there, use `TMPDIR` 
   if defined.
 - FIXED: Make `./ciao-boot.sh clean` work even if
   `core` is not built.
 - FIXED: Make sure that building `core` prepares the bin grade
   (`core.ciaobase`). 

Language, compiler, and toplevel:
 - ADDED: Out-of-tree builds, enabled by default. Use
   `CIAOCCACHE=0` to disable it. The compilation of modules
   under a bundle produces `.itf` and `.po` files located in
   the build/cache directory of their corresponding workspace.
 - ENHANCED: Using atomic file writes everywhere in the
   compiler. Now several processes may compile simultaneously the
   same code base without corrupting the `.po`/`.itf` 
   compiler output files (there are a few documented bugs in the
   build scripts that should be fixed in the next commits to allow
   parallel systems builds).
 - ENHANCED: New internal representation for predicate
   abstraction, which fixes a potential performance problem due to
   unnecessary renaming of shared variables.
 - ENHANCED: Pretty printing of solutions from the toplevel is
   now orders of magnitude faster for some corner cases.
 - CHANGED: Using standard hiord argument order. This changes
   the argument ordering for predicate abstractions for `hiord` 
   to make it compatible with other systems and languages. The old
   order was implemented to favor 1st argument indexing, but it
   can be confusing because of the difference with other languages
   with higher-order (specially for partial applications).
   Note that was overdue because it was a complicated backwards
   incompatible change that required many changes in the compiler
   and libraries (including the assertion language, parametric
   properties, runtime checks, and parts of the CiaoPP analysis
   framework).
 - CHANGED: Made the semantics of shared variables in
   predicate abstractions more strict. Now only the variables
   specified in `ShVs` for `call((ShVs -> ''(...) :- ...), ...)` 
   will share with the caller's body variables. No other
   variables will be implicitly shared.
 - CHANGED: Conditional compilation is built-in in the
   compiler now. This improves the portability of some
   experimental libraries.
 - EXPERIMENTAL: `string_type` package for native strings.
 - EXPERIMENTAL: a default behavior was defined for
   `ciao-serve` so that it provides the available manuals in
   `index.html` (via the HTTP protocol).
 - FIXED: Make partial application work as expected (e.g.,
   `X=append, Y = X([1]), Y([2], Z)`)
 - FIXED: Syntactic errors in assertion normalization are now
   treated correctly by `c_itf.pl`.
 - FIXED: Program point assertions
   (`check/1`,`true/1`,etc.) are not removed by
   `mexpand.pl` 
 - FIXED: `load_compilation_module/1` was incorrectly
   ignoring modules that were already processed (e.g., compiled)
   but not loaded in the context of `c_itf.pl`.
 - ENHANCED: Pretty printing of solutions detects cyclic terms
   automatically. The `check_cycles` flag is no longer needed
   and has been removed.
 - REMOVED: `check_cycles` flag is no longer needed. 

Engine:
 - ADDED: Support for `aarch64` on Android (using Termux).

 - FIXED: Fixed round-trip property in float to string and
   string to float conversions. The new code is based on the
   extremely fast Ryu algorithm (see 2018 paper).

   ensures that `engine/` files are copied in global
   installations).
 - FIXED: Thread-safe and more efficient reimplementation of
   exceptions.
 - FIXED: Handler for signals that are not intercepted.
 - FIXED: Fix right shift of negative `smallint`. For
   `Shift` in 0..70 and `V=(-1<<57)` or `V=(-1)`, `X
   is V>>Shift` produced `X=0` instead of a negative number. 

Runtime checks, testing, and debugging:
 - ADDED: New `timeout/2` property for test assertions (10
   min default).

   compatibility package) 

Ciao emacs mode:
 - ENHANCED: Indentation code rewritten (supporting block
   syntax, better indentation of if-then-else, argument-based
   indentation for columns).
 - ENHANCED: New syntax coloring code (better multiline
   coloring of strings and comments, quoted atoms, doccomments
   blocks, documentation commands, assertion syntax)
 - ENHANCED: Coloring of info manuals generated by LPdoc.
 - ENHANCED: Do not set tty colors for ciao faces (modern
   terminals look great with the default colors).

## [1.18.0] - 2018-12-06 

Backward-incompatible changes in this version:
 - Changed the defaults for modules declared with
   `module/3`. The following predicates and features are no
   longer included by default in module/3. They should be
   enabled explicitly with the following packages or modules:
   - `call/N`: `hiord` package.
   - `data`, `concurrent` declarations,
     `assertz_fact/1`, etc.: `datafacts` package.
   - `dynamic` declarations, `assertz/1`, etc.:
     `dynamic` package.
   - `set_prolog_flag/2`, etc.:
     `engine(runtime_control)` (which merges deprecated
     `engine(prolog_flags)` and `engine(prolog_sys)`).
   - nl/0, nl/1, display/0, open/3, etc.: library(streams)
     (which reexports stream handling and operations, namely
     `engine(stream_basic)` and `engine(io_basic)`). 
 - Added `noprelude` that prevents loading the prelude
   (default definitions).
 - The `pure` package now includes a minimum set of
   control constructs `(,)/2`, `true/0`, `fail/0`. 

Language, compiler, toplevel:
 - Major update of the Ciao manual (basic language, language
   extensions, Ciao standard library, additional libraries,
   abstract data types, ISO and compatibility, etc.).
 - Built-in build system and software packaging system
   (*bundles*) (see documentation for details).
 - Added (optional) `CIAOROOT` and `CIAOPATH` 
   environment variables (replace `CIAOLIB`). `CIAOROOT` 
   points to the root of the Ciao sources rather than the lib
   directory.
 - New `ciao-env` command to set up the environment for
   some specific Ciao installations.
 - Fix `MANPATH`,`INFOPATH` in `ciao-env` (trailing
   `:` was incorrectly removed, it is meaningful and
   represents default paths).
 - Fixed `ciaosh -e Goal` (accepts any goal), removed
   `-g` option.
 - DCG `phrase/3` available by default in classic mode
   (toplevel, user modules, and modules declared with
   `module/2`).
 - Fixes in runtime check versions of `mshare/1`,
   `indep/1`, `indep/2`, and `covered/2`.
 - Fixed issues with cyclic terms in debugger (when
   `check_cycles` flag is activated).
 - (experimental) `ciao-serve` command to start a Ciao
   server to serve both HTTP and active module requests. 

Ciao emacs mode:
 - Added `M-x ciao-set-ciao-root`, `M-x
   ciao-set-ciao-path` (see `CIAOROOT` and `CIAOPATH` 
   changes).
 - Improved syntax highlighting. 

Engine:
 - Fixed a bug while freeing sources in `eng_call/@{3,4@}`.
 - Fixed bug in dynamic/data predicates (uninitialized
   registers may lead to memory corruption during garbage
   collection).
 - Added `ciao_root/1`, replaces `ciao_lib_dir/1`.
 - Improved documentation and examples for interfacing with
   C/C++ (including embedding engines in C/C++ applications). 

Libraries:
 - Fixed bug in tokenizer (dealing with `\\^` escape
   sequences in strings).
 - Refurbished HTTP libraries (separated from pillow, see
   documentation).
 - Added `library(io_port_reify)` (like `port_reify` 
   but allows IO redirection).
 - Added `filter/3`, `partition/4`, `maplist/N` to
   `library(hiordlib)`.
 - Added `library(opendoc)` (opens a document with the
   default OS viewer).
 - Revamped active modules model and implementation (see
   documentation for details).
 - Renamed `library(file_utils)` to
   `library(stream_utils)`.
 - Predicates `stream_to_string/@{2,3@}` replaced by
   `read_to_end/@{2,3@}` (which do not close the stream).
 - Added `library(terms_io)` (`terms_to_file/2`,
   `file_to_terms/2`).
 - (experimental) `library(timeout)` 
   (`call_with_time_limit/@{2,3@}`).
 - (experimental) package for traits (interfaces).

Engine:
 - Generating the emulator loop with our own code expansion
   and emulator generator (emugen).

   multiplication overflows using `__builtin_smul_overflow` 
   to avoid C undefined behaviours, i.e., in clang).
 - Fixes in bignums and float to integer conversion in
   64-bits mode.
 - `lib/engine/` merged into `engine/` (no need to
   separate Prolog and C files).

   assume `EOF == -1`).
 - `CIAOARCH` replaced by `CIAOOS` (e.g., Linux) and
   `CIAOARCH` (e.g., `i686`). New `ciao_sysconf` 
   command (replaces `ciao_get_arch` script), which accepts
   the arguments `--os`, `--arch`, and `--osarch`. 

Portability and OS support:
 - Using `clang` as default C compiler in MacOS.

   on abort, e.g., due to uncaught exceptions or unexpected
   failure.
 - New `ciaoc_sdyn` tool to help in the distribution of
   standalone executables with foreign code (collects all
   required dynamic libraries).
 - Starting work on new build system.
 - (experimental) syntax extension for infix dot `(A.B)` 
   (see `set_prolog_flag(read_infix_dot, on)`).
 - (experimental) syntax extension for string data type (see
   `set_prolog_flag(read_string_data_type, on)`). 

Libraries:
 - Fix `system:touch/1`, implemented through C
   `utime()`.
 - Fix buffer overflow in `absolute_file_name/?` with
   `nul/NUL` in Win32 (it is a reserved name).
 - Fix bug in check for cyclic terms, implemented faster C
   (low-level) version.
 - Fix `get_tmp_dir/1` so that it always produces a
   normalized path, with no trailing `/`, and considering
   `TMPDIR` on POSIX systems.
 - Better use of `current_executable/1` implementation
   (macOS: `_NSGetExecutablePath()`, Linux: `readlink` on
   `/proc/self/exe`, Windows: `GetModuleFileName()` with
   `hModule = NULL`).
 - Added support for `phrase/2` and `phrase/3` in DCGs
   (in `dcg_phrase` package).

   interface for child process creation, supporting stream
   redirection, background processes, signals, etc.
 - Added `library(text_template)`, text-based templates.

   (`set_heap_limit/1`).
 - (experimental) `library(stream_wait)`, wait for input
   to be available, with timeouts.

## [1.14.2] - 2011-08-12 

Merging r13606 (trunk) into 1.14.
This backports an optimization for DARWIN platforms (Jose Morales)
 
## [1.14.1] - 2011-08-10 

Merging r13583 through r13586 (trunk) into 1.14. This fixes problems
in the Windows version of Ciao (Edison Mera, Jose Morales)
 
## [1.15.0] - 2011-07-08 

New development version (Jose Morales)
 
## [1.14.0] - 2011-07-08 

It has been a long while since declaring the last major version
(basically since moving to subversion after 1.10/1.12), so quite a bit
is included in this release. Here is the (longish) summary.
 
Extensions to functional notation:
 - Introduced `fsyntax` package (just functional
   syntax). (Daniel Cabeza)
 - Added support to define on the fly a return argument
   different from the default one
   (e.g. `~functor(~,f,2)`). (Daniel Cabeza)
 - Use of '`:- function(defined(true)).`' so that the
   defined function does not need to be preceded by `~` in the
   return expression of a functional clause. (Daniel Cabeza)
 - Functional notation: added to documentation to reflect more
   of the FLOPS paper text and explanations. Added new
   functional syntax examples: arrays, combination with
   constraints, using func notation for properties, lazy
   evaluation, etc. (Manuel Hermenegildo)
 - Added functional abstractions to `fsyntax` and correct
   handling of predicate abstractions (the functions in the body
   where expanded outside the abstraction). (Jose Morales)
 - Improved translation of functions. In particular, old
   translation could lose last call optimization for functions
   with body or with conditional expressions. Furthermore, the
   translation avoids now some superfluous intermediate
   unifications. To be studied more involved
   optimizations. (Daniel Cabeza, Jose Morales).
 - More superfluous unifications taken out from translated code,
   in cases where a goal `~f(X) = /Term/` appears in the
   body. (Daniel Cabeza)
 - Added `library/argnames_fsyntax.pl`: Package to be able to
   use `$~/2` as an operator. (Daniel Cabeza)
 - Added a new example for lazy evaluation, saving memory using
   lazy instead of eager evaluation. (Amadeo Casas) 

Improvements to signals and exceptions:
 - Distinguished between exceptions and signals. Exceptions are
   thrown and caught (using @pred{throw/1} and @pred{catch/3}).
   Signals are sent and intercepted (using @pred{send_signal/1} 
   and @pred{intercept/3}). (Jose Morales, Remy Haemmerle)
 - Back-port of the (improved) low-level exception handling from
   `optim_comp` branch. (Jose Morales)
 - Fixed @pred{intercept/3} bug, with caused the toplevel to not
   properly handle exceptions after one was handled and
   displayed (bug reported by Samir Genaim on 04 Dec 05, in ciao
   mailing list, subject ```ciao top-level : exception
   handling`''). Updated documentation. (Daniel Cabeza)
 - @pred{intercept/3} does not leave pending choice points if
   the called goal is deterministic (the same optimization that
   was done for @pred{catch/3}). (Jose Morales) 

New/improved libraries:
 - New `assoc` library to represent association tables.
   (Manuel Carro, Pablo Chico)
 - New `regexp` library to handle regular expressions.
   (Manuel Carro, Pablo Chico)
 - Fixed bug in string_to_number that affected ASCII to
   floating point number conversions (@pred{number_codes/2} 
   and bytecode read). (Jose Morales)
 - `system.pl`: Added predicates @pred{copy_file/2} and
   @pred{copy_file/3}. Added predicates @pred{get_uid/1},
   @pred{get_gid/1}, @pred{get_pwnam/1}, @pred{get_grnam/1} 
   implemented natively to get default user and groups of the
   current process. (Edison Mera)
 - Added library for mutable variables. (Remy Haemmerle)
 - Added package for block declarations (experimental). (Remy
   Haemmerle)
 - Ported CHR as a Ciao package (experimental). (Tom
   Schrijvers)
 - Debugged and improved performance of the CHR library port.
   (Remy Haemmerle)
 - `contrib/math`: A library with several math functions
   that depends on the GNU Scientific Library (GSL). (Edison
   Mera)
 - `io_aux.pl`: Added @pred{messages/1} 
   predicate. Required to facilitate printing of compact
   messages (compatible with emacs). (Edison Mera)
 - Added library `hrtimer.pl` that allow us to measure the
   time using the higest resolution timer available in the
   current system. (Edison Mera)
 - Global logical (backtrackable) variables (experimental).
   (Jose Morales)
 - New dynamic handling (`dynamic_clauses` package). Not
   yet documented. (Daniel Cabeza)
 - Moved `\\=` from `iso_misc` to
   `term_basic`. (Daniel Cabeza)
 - `lib/lists.pl`: Added predicate
   @pred{sequence_to_list/2}. (Daniel Cabeza)
 - `lib/lists.pl`: Codification of @pred{subordlist/2} 
   improved. Solutions are given in other order. (Daniel
   Cabeza)
 - `lib/filenames.pl`: Added
   @pred{file_directory_base_name/3}. (Daniel Cabeza)
 - `library/symlink_locks.pl`: preliminary library to make
   locks a la emacs. (Daniel Cabeza)
 - `lib/between.pl`: Bug in `between/3` fixed: when the
   low bound was a float, an smaller integer was
   generated. (Daniel Cabeza)
 - Fixed bug related to implication operator `->` in Fuzzy
   Prolog (Claudio Vaucheret)
 - `contrib/gendot`: Generator of dot files, for drawing graphs
   using the dot tool. (Claudio Ochoa)
 - Addded `zeromq` library (bindings for the Zero Message
   Queue (ZeroMQ, 0MQ) cross-platform messaging middleware)
   (Dragan Ivanovic)
 - Minor documentation changes in `javall` library (Jesus
   Correas)
 - Fix a bug in calculator `pl2java` example (Jesus
   Correas)
 - `lib/aggregates.pl`: Deleted duplicated clauses of
   @pred{findnsols/4}, detected by Pawel. (Daniel Cabeza)
 - Added library to transform between color spaces (HSL and
   HVS) (experimental). (Jose Morales)
 - Added module qualification in DCGs. (Remy Haemmerle, Jose
   Morales)
 - @pred{prolog_sys:predicate_property/2} behaves similar to
   other Prolog systems (thanks to Paulo Moura for reporting
   this bug). (Jose Morales)
 - Added DHT library (implementation of distributed hash
   table) (Arsen Kostenko)
 - Adding property `intervals/2` in `native_props.pl` 
   (for intervals information) (Luthfi Darmawan)
 - Added code to call polynomial root finding of GSL (Luthfi
   Darmawan)
 - Some improvements (not total, but easy to complete) to
   error messages given by errhandle.pl . Also, some of the
   errors in `sockets_c.c` are now proper exceptions
   instead of faults. (Manuel Carro)
 - `sockets` library: added a library (`nsl`) needed
   for Solaris (Manuel Carro)
 - Driver, utilities, and benchmarking programs from the ECRC
   suite. These are aimed at testing some well-defined
   characteristics of a Prolog system. (Manuel Carro)
 - `library/getopts.pl`: A module to get command-line
   options and values. Intended to be used by Ciao
   executables. (Manuel Carro) 

Improved ISO compliance:
 - Ported the Prolog ISO conformance testing.
 - Fixed read of files containing single ```%`'' char
   (reported by Ulrich Neumerkel). (Jose Morales)
 - Added exceptions in @pred{=../2}. (Remy Haemmerle)
 - Added exceptions in arithmetic predicates. (Remy
   Haemmerle)
 - Arithmetics integer functions throw exceptions when used
   with floats. (Remy Haemmerle)
 - Added exceptions for resource errors. (Remy Haemmerle) 

Improvements to constraint solvers:
 - Improved CLPQ documentation. (Manuel Hermenegildo)
 - Added `clp_meta/1` and `clp_entailed/1` to the clpq and clpr
   packages (Samir Genaim):
   - `clp_meta/1`: meta-programming with clp constraints,
     e.g, `clp_meta([A.>.B,B.>.1])`.
   - `clp_entailed/1`: checks if the store entails
     specific cnstraints, e.g, `clp_entailed([A.>.B])` 
     succeeds if the current store entailes `A.>.B`,
     otherwise fails. 
 - Exported the simplex predicates from CLP(Q,R). (Samir Genaim) 

Other language extensions:
 - Added new `bf/bfall` package. It allows running all
   predicates in a given module in breadth-first mode without
   changing the syntax of the clauses (i.e., no `<-` 
   needed). Meant basically for experimentation and,
   specially, teaching pure logic programming. (Manuel
   Hermenegildo)
 - Added `afall` package in the same line as `bf/bfall` 
   (very useful!). (Manuel Hermenegildo)
 - Improved documentation of `bf` and `af` 
   packages. (Manuel Hermenegildo)
 - Added partial commons-style dialect support, including
   dialect flag. (Manuel Hermenegildo)
 - `yap_compat` and `commons_compat` compatibility
   packages (for Yap and Prolog Commons dialects). (Jose
   Morales)
 - `argnames` package: enhanced to allow argument name
   resolution at runtime. (Jose Morales)
 - A package for conditional compilation of code (`:-
   use_package(condcomp)`). (Jose Morales) 

Extensions for parallelism (And-Prolog):
 - Low-level support for andprolog library has been taken out
   of the engine and moved to `library/apll` in a similar
   way as the sockets library. We are planning to reduce the
   size of the actual engine further, by taking some
   components out of engine, such as locks, in future
   releases. (Amadeo Casas)
 - Improved support for deterministic parallel goals,
   including some bug fixes. (Amadeo Casas)
 - Goal stack definition added to the engine. (Amadeo Casas)
 - And-parallel code and the definition of goal stacks in the
   engine are now wrapped with conditionals (via
   `AND_PARALLEL_EXECUTION` variable), to avoid the
   machinery necessary to run programs in parallel affects in
   any case the sequential execution. (Amadeo Casas)
 - Stack expansion supported when more than one agent is
   present in the execution of parallel deterministic
   programs. This feature is still in experimental. Support
   for stack expansion in nondeterministic benchmarks will be
   added in a future release. (Amadeo Casas)
 - Support for stack unwinding in deterministic parallel
   programs, via `metachoice`/`metacut`. However,
   garbage collection in parallel programs is still
   unsupported. We are planning to include support for it in
   a future release. (Amadeo Casas)
 - Backward execution of nondeterministic parallel goals made
   via events, without speculation and continuation
   join. (Amadeo Casas)
 - Improved agents support. New primitives included that aim
   at increasing the flexibility of creation and management
   of agents. (Amadeo Casas)
 - Agents synchronization is done now by using locks, instead
   of using `assertz`/`retract`, to improve efficiency
   in the execution of parallel programs. (Amadeo Casas)
 - Optimized version of `call/1` to invoke deterministic
   goals in parallel has been added
   (`call_handler_det/1`). (Amadeo Casas)
 - Optimization: locks/`new_atom` only created when the
   goal is stolen by other process, and not when this is
   pushed on to the `goal_stack`. (Amadeo Casas)
 - Integration with the new annotation algorithms supported
   by CiaoPP, both with and without preservation of the order
   of the solutions. (Amadeo Casas)
 - New set of examples added to the `andprolog` 
   library. (Amadeo Casas)
 - Several bug fixes to remove some cases in execution of
   parallel code in which races could appear. (Amadeo Casas)
 - `andprolog_rt:&` by `par_rt:&` have been moved to
   `native_builtin` (Amadeo Casas)
 - `indep/1` and `indep/2` have been moved to
   `native_props`, as `ground/1`, `var/1`,
   etc. (Amadeo Casas)
 - Added assertions to the `library/apll` and
   `library/andprolog` libraries. (Amadeo Casas)
 - Removed clauses in `pretty_print` for the `&>/2` and
   `<&/1` operators. (Amadeo Casas)
 - Shorter code for `<& / 1` and `<&! / 1` (Manuel
   Carro)
 - Trying to solve some problems when resetting WAM pointers
   (Manuel Carro)
 - Better code to clean the stacks (Manuel Carro) 

Improvements to foreign (C language) interface:
 - Better support for cygwin and handling of dll libraries in
   Windows. Now usage of external dll libraries are supported
   in Windows under cygwin. (Edison Mera)
 - Improvements to documentation of foreign interface (examples).
   (Manuel Hermenegildo)
 - Allow reentrant calls from Prolog to C and then from C to
   Prolog. (Jose Morales)
 - Fix bug that prevented `ciaoc -c MODULE` from generating
   dynamic `.so` libraries files. (Jose Morales)
 - Fix bug that prevented `ciaoc MODULE && rm MODULE && ciaoc
   MODULE` from emitting correct executables (previously,
   dynamic `.so` libraries files where ignored in executable
   recompilations when only the main file was missing). (Jose
   Morales) 

Run-Time Checking and Unit Tests:
 - Added support to perfom run-time checking of assertions
   and predicates outside @apl{ciaopp} (see the documentation
   for more details). In addition to those already
   available, the new properties that can be run-time checked
   are: `exception/1`, `exception/2`,
   `no_exception/1`, `no_exception/2`,
   `user_output/2`, `solutions/2`,
   `num_solutions/2`, `no_signal/1`, `no_signal/2`,
   `signal/1`, `signal/2`, `signals/2`,
   `throws/2`. See library
   `assertions/native_props.pl` (Edison Mera)
 - Added support for testing via the @lib{unittest} library.
   Documentation available at
   `library(unittest/unittest)`. (Edison Mera) 

Profiling:
 - Improved profiler, now it is cost center-based and works
   together with the run-time checking machinery in order to
   also validate execution time-related properties. (Edison
   Mera)
 - A tool for automatic bottleneck detection has been
   developed, which is able to point at the predicates
   responsible of lack of performance in a program. (Edison
   Mera)
 - Improved profiler documentation. (Manuel Hermenegildo) 

Debugger enhancements:
 - Added the flag `check_cycles` to control whether the
   debugger takes care of cyclic terms while displaying
   goals. The rationale is that to check for cyclic terms
   may lead to very high response times when having big
   terms. By default the flag is in off, which implies that
   a cyclic term in the execution could cause infinite loops
   (but otherwise the debugger is much more speedy). (Daniel
   Cabeza)
 - Show the variable names instead of underscores with
   numbers. Added option `v` to show the variables
   list. Added `v <N>` option, where `N` is the
   `Name` of the variable you like to watch
   (experimental). (Edison Mera)
 - Distinguish between program variables and
   compiler-introduced variables. Show variables modified in
   the current goal. (Edison Mera)
 - `debug_mode` does not leave useless choicepoints (Jose
   Morales) 

Emacs mode:
 - Made ciao mode NOT ask by default if one wants to set up
   version control when first saving a file. This makes more
   sense if using other version control systems and probably
   in any case (several users had asked for this). There is a
   global customizable variable (which appears in the LPdoc
   area) which can be set to revert to the old behaviour.
   Updated the manual accordingly. (Manuel Hermenegildo)
 - Added possibility of chosing which emacs Ciao should use
   during compilation, by LPdoc, etc. Previously only a
   default emacs was used which is not always the right
   thing, specially, e.g., in Mac OS X, where the
   latest/right emacs may not even be in the paths. Other
   minor typos etc. (Manuel Hermenegildo)
 - Moved the version control menu entries to the LPdoc
   menu. (Manuel Hermenegildo)
 - Updated highlighting for new functional syntax, unit
   tests, and all other new features. (Manuel Hermenegildo)
 - Completed CiaoPP-java environment (menus, buttons, etc.)
   and automated loading when visiting Java files (still
   through hand modification of .emacs). CiaoPP help (e.g.,
   for properties) now also available in Java mode. (Manuel
   Hermenegildo)
 - Changes to graphical interface to adapt better to current
   functionality of CiaoPP option browser. Also some minor
   aesthetic changes. (Manuel Hermenegildo)
 - Various changes and fixes to adapt to emacs-22/23 lisp. In
   particular, fixed cursor error in emacs 23 in Ciao shell
   (from Emilio Gallego). Also fixed prompt in ciaopp and
   LPdoc buffers for emacs 23. (Manuel Hermenegildo)
 - Unified several versions of the Ciao emacs mode (including
   the one with the experimental toolbar in xemacs) that had
   diverged. Sorely needed to be able to make progress
   without duplication. (Manuel Hermenegildo)
 - New version of ciao.el supporting tool bar in xemacs and
   also, and perhaps more importantly, in newer emacsen (>=
   22), where it previously did not work either. New icons
   with opaque background for xemacs tool bar. (Manuel
   Hermenegildo)
 - Using `key-description` instead of a combination of
   `text-char-description` and `string-to-char`. This
   fixes a bug in the Ciao Emacs Mode when running in emacs
   23, that shows wrong descriptions for `M-...` key
   bindings. The new code runs correctly in emacs 21 and 22.
   (Jose Morales)
 - Coloring strings before functional calls and `0'` 
   characters (strings like `"~w"` were colored
   incorrectly) (Jose Morales)
 - `@@begin@{verbatim@}` and `@@include` colored as
   LPdoc commands only inside LPdoc comments. (Jose Morales)
 - Fixed colors for dark backgrounds (workaround to avoid a
   bug in emacs) (Jose Morales)
 - Added an automatic indenter (contrib/plindent) and
   formatting tool, under emacs you can invoque it using the
   keyword `C-c I` in the current buffer containing your
   prolog source. (Edison Mera) 

Packaging and distribution:
 - User-friendly, binary installers for several systems are
   now generated regularly and automatically: Ubuntu/Debian,
   Fedora/RedHat, Windows (XP, Vista, 7) and MacOSX. (Edison
   Mera, Remy Haemmerle) 

Improvements in Ciao toplevel:
 - Introduced `check_cycles` `prolog_flag` which
   controls whether the toplevel handles or not cyclic terms.
   Flag is set to false by default (cycles not detected and
   handled) in order to speed up responses. (Daniel Cabeza)
 - Modified @pred{valid_solution/2} so that it asks no
   question when there are no pending choice points and the
   `prompt_alternatives_no_bindings` prolog flag is
   on. (Jose Morales)
 - Now 'Y' can be used as well as 'y' to accept a solution of a
   query. (Daniel Cabeza)
 - Added newline before `true` when displaying empty
   solutions. (Jose Morales)
 - Multifile declarations of packages used by the toplevel were
   not properly handled. Fixed. (Daniel Cabeza)
 - Fixed bug in output of bindings when current output
   changed.
 - Changes so that including files in the toplevel (or loading
   packages) does not invoke an expansion of the ending
   `end_of_file`. This makes sense because the toplevel code is
   never completed, and thus no cleanup code of translations is
   invoked. (Daniel Cabeza) 

Compiler enhancements and bug fixes:
 - Added a command line option to `ciaoc` for generating code
   with runtime checks. (Daniel Cabeza)
 - Now the compiler reads assertions by default (when using the
   assertion package), and verifies their syntax. (Edison Mera)
 - Added option `-w` to `ciaoc` compiler to generate the
   WAM code of the specified prolog files. (Edison Mera)
 - Fixed bug in exemaker: now when
   @pred{main/0} and @pred{main/1} exists, @pred{main/0} is
   always the program entry (before in modules either could
   be). (Daniel Cabeza)
 - Fixed bug: when compiling a file, if an imported file had no
   itf and it used the redefining declaration, the declaration was
   forgotten between the reading of the imported file (to get
   its interface) and its later compilation. By now those
   declarations are never forgotten, but perhaps it could be
   done better. (Daniel Cabeza)
 - The unloading of files kept some data related to them, which
   caused in some cases errors or warnings regarding module
   redefinitions. Now this is fixed. (Daniel Cabeza)
 - Undefined predicate warnings also for predicate calls
   qualified with current module (bug detected by Pawel
   Pietrzak). (Daniel Cabeza)
 - Fixed bug `debugger_include` (that is, now a change in a
   file included from a module which is debugged is detected
   when the module is reloaded). (Daniel Cabeza)
 - Fixed `a(B) :- _=B, b, c(B)` bug in compilation of
   unification. (Jose Morales) 

Improving general support for language extensions:
 - Every package starts with '`:- package(...)`' declaration
   now. This allows a clear distinction between packages,
   modules, and files that are just included; all of them using
   the same `.pl` extension. (Jose Morales)
 - Added priority in syntax translations. Users are not required
   to know the details of translations in order to use them
   (experimental: the the correct order for all the Ciao
   packages is still not fixed) (Jose Morales)
 - Now the initialization of sentence translations is done in
   the translation package, when they are added. In this way,
   previous active translations cannot affect the initialization
   of new translations, and initializations are not started each
   time a new sentence translation is added. Additionally, now
   the initialization of sentence translations in the toplevel
   is done (there was a bug). (Daniel Cabeza)
 - Added `addterm(Meta)` meta-data specification for the
   implementation of the changes to provide a correct
   @pred{clause/2} predicate. (Daniel Cabeza)
 - Generalized `addmodule` meta-data specification to
   `addmodule(Meta)`, `addmodule` is now an alias for
   `addmodule(?)`. Needed for the implementation of the
   changes to provide a correct @pred{clause/2} 
   predicate. (Daniel Cabeza) 

Improvements to system assertions:
 - Added regtype @pred{basic_props:num_code/1} and more
   assertions to `basic_props.pl` (German Puebla)
 - Added trust assertion for
   @pred{atomic_basic:number_codes/2} in order to have more
   accurate analysis info (first argument a number and second
   argument is a list of num_codes) (German Puebla)
 - Added some more binding insensitivity assertions in
   `basic_props.pl` (German Puebla)
 - Added the @pred{basic_props:filter/2} property which is
   used at the global control level in order to guarantee
   termination. (German Puebla)
 - Added `equiv` assertion for @pred{basiccontrol:fail/0} 
   (German Puebla)
 - Modified eval assertion so that partial evaluation does
   not loop with ill-typed, semi-instantiated calls to
   @pred{is/2} (this problem was reported some time ago)
   (German Puebla)
 - Replaced `true` assertions for arithmetic predicates
   with `trust` assertions (`arithmetic.pl`). (German
   Puebla)
 - Added assertions for @pred{term_basic:'\\='/2} (the *not
   unification*) (German Puebla)
 - Added assertions for @pred{lists:nth/3} predicate and
   @pred{lists:reverse/3}. (German Puebla)
 - Changed calls to @pred{atom/1} to @pred{atm/1} in
   @pred{c_itf_props:moddesc/1} (it is a regular type) (Jesus
   Correas)
 - @pred{formulae:assert_body_type/1} switched to `prop`,
   it is not a `regtype`. (Jesus Correas)
 - Added assertions to @pred{atom_concat/2}. (Jesus Correas)
 - Added some assertions to `dec10_io`, `lists`,
   `strings` libraries. (Jesus Correas)
 - Removed `check` from pred and success froom many
   library assertions. (Jesus Correas)
 - Fixed a problem when reading multiple disjunction in
   assertions (`library/formulae.pl` and
   `lib/assertions/assrt_write.pl`). (Pawel Pietrzak)
 - Added/improved assertions in several modules under
   `lib/` (Pawel Pietrzak) 

Engine enhancements:
 - Added support for Ciao compilation in `ppc64` 
   architecture. (Manuel Carro)
 - `sun4v` added in `ciao_get_arch`. (Amadeo Casas)
 - Solved compilation issue in Sparc. (Manuel Carro, Amadeo
   Casas)
 - Support for 64 bits Intel processor (in 32-bit compatibility
   mode). (Manuel Carro)
 - Switched the default memory manager from linear to the binary
   tree version (which improves management of small memory
   blocks). (Remy Haemmerle)
 - Using `mmap` in Linux/i86, Linux/Sparc and Mac OS X
   (Manuel Carro)
 - A rename of the macro `REGISTER` to `CIAO_REGISTER`.
   There have been reports of the macro name clashing with an
   equally-named one in third-party packages (namely, the PPL
   library). (Manuel Carro)
 - A set of macros `CIAO_REG_n` (`n` currently goes from
   `1` to `4`, but it can be enlarged) to force the GCC
   compiler to store a variable in a register. This includes
   assignments of hardware registers for `n = 1` to `3`,
   in seemingly ascending order of effectiveness. See coments
   in registers.h (Manuel Carro)
 - An assignement of (local) variables to be definitely stored
   in registers for some (not all) functions in the engine --
   notably `wam.c`. These were decided making profiling of C
   code to find out bottlenecks and many test runs with
   different assignments of C variables to registers. (Manuel
   Carro)
 - Changed symbol name to avoid clashes with other third-party
   packages (such as minisat). (Manuel Carro)
 - Fixed a memory alignment problem (for RISC architectures
   where words must be word-aligned, like Sparc). (Jose Morales)
 - Unifying some internal names (towards merge with optim_comp
   experimental branch). (Jose Morales) 

Attributed variables:
 - Attributes of variables are correctly displayed in the
   toplevel even if they contain cyclic terms. Equations added
   in order to define cyclic terms in attributes are output
   after the attributes, and do use always new variable names
   (doing otherwise was very involved). (Daniel Cabeza)
 - `lib/attrdump.pl`: The library now works for infinite
   (cyclic) terms. (Daniel Cabeza)
 - Changed multifile predicate @pred{dump/3} to
   @pred{dump_constraints/3}. (Daniel Cabeza)
 - Added @pred{copy_extract_attr_nc/3} which is a faster version
   of @pred{copy_extract_attr/3} but does not handle cyclic
   terms properly. (Daniel Cabeza)
 - Added @pred{term_basic:copy_term_nat/2} to copy a term
   taking out attributes. (Daniel Cabeza) 

Documentation:
 - Added `deprecated/1`. (Manuel Hermenegildo)
 - Improvements to documentation of `rtchecks` and
   tests. (Manuel Hermenegildo)
 - Many updates to manuals: dates, copyrights, etc. Some text
   updates also. (Manuel Hermenegildo)
 - Fixed all manual generation errors reported by LPdoc
   (still a number of warnings and notes left). (Manuel
   Hermenegildo)
 - Adding some structure (minor) to all manuals (Ciao, LPdoc,
   CiaoPP) using new LPdoc `doc_structure/1`. (Jose
   Morales) 

Ciao Website:
 - Redesigned the Ciao website. It is generated again through
   LPdoc, but with new approach. (Jose Morales)  
 
## [1.10.8] - 2007-01-28 

Backports and bug fixes to stable 1.10:

 - Changes to make Ciao 1.10 compile with the latest GCC
   releases.
 - Imported from
   `CiaoDE/branches/CiaoDE-memory_management-20051016`,
   changes from revisions 4909 to 4910: Changes to make Ciao
   issue a better message at startup if the allocated memory
   does not fall within the limits precomputed at compile time
   (plus some code tidying).
 - Port of revisions 5415, 5426, 5431, 5438, 5546, 5547 applied
   to Ciao 1.13 to Ciao 1.10 in order to make it use `mmap()` 
   when possible and to make it compile on newer Linux kernels.
   Tested in Ubuntu, Fedora (with older kernel) and MacOSX.
 - Configuration files for DARWIN (ppc) and 64-bit platforms
   (Intel and Sparc, both in 32-bit compatibility mode).
 - Force the creation of the module containing the foreign
   interface compilation options before they are needed.

## [1.9.38] - 2002-12-12

Manual now posted in pdf format (since lpdoc now generates much better pdf).
(Manuel Hermenegildo)
 
## [1.9.34] - 2002-11-30

Installation can now be done in Test distribution directory (for
testing purposes).  (Manuel Hermenegildo)
 
## [1.9.33] - 2002-11-30

Modified installation site text to make more explicit the fact that we
support Mac OS X and XP.  (Manuel Hermenegildo)
 
## [1.9.0] - 2002-05-16 

New development version after stable 1.8p0 (MCL, DCG)
 
@comment{TODO: (pre SVN) missing notes from 1.8.0 to 1.8.3} 
 
## [1.8.0] - 2002-05-16 

 - Improvements related to supported platforms:
   - Support for Mac OS X 10.1, based on the Darwin kernel.
   - Initial support for compilation on Linux for Power PC
     (contributed by @author{Paulo Moura}).
   - Workaround for incorrect C compilation while using newer
     (> 2.95) gcc compilers.
   - .bat files generated in Windows. 
 
 - Changes in compiler behavior and user interface:
   - Corrected a bug which caused wrong code generation in some cases.
   - Changed execution of initialization directives. Now the
     initialization of a module/file never runs before the
     initializations of the modules from which the module/file
     imports (excluding circular dependences).
   - The engine is more intelligent when looking for an engine
     to execute bytecode; this caters for a variety of
     situations when setting explicitly the CIAOLIB
     environment variable.
   - Fixed bugs in the toplevel: behaviour of `module:main` 
     calls and initialization of a module (now happens after
     related modules are loaded).
   - Layout char not needed any more to end Prolog files.
   - Syntax errors now disable .itf creation, so that they
     show next time the code is used without change.
   - Redefinition warnings now issued only when an unqualified call
     is seen.
   - Context menu in Windows can now load a file into the toplevel.
   - Updated Windows installation in order to run CGI
     executables under Windows: a new information item is
     added to the registry.
   - Added new directories found in recent Linux distributions to
     INFOPATH.
   - Emacs-based environment and debugger improved:
     - Errors located immediataly after code loading.
     - Improved ciao-check-types-modes (preprocessor progress
       now visible).
     - Fixed loading regions repeatedly (no more predicate
       redefinition warnings).
     - Added entries in @apl{ciaopp} menu to set verbosity of output.
     - Fixed some additional xemacs compatibility issues
       (related to searches).
     - Errors reported by inferior processes are now
       explored in forward order (i.e., the first error
       rewported is the first one highlighted). Improved
       tracking of errors.
     - Specific tool bar now available, with icons for main
       fuctions (works from emacs 21.1 on). Also, other
       minor adaptations for working with emacs 21.1 and
       later.
     - Debugger faces are now locally defined (and better
       customization). This also improves comtability with xemacs
       (which has different faces).
     - Direct access to a common use of the preprocessor
       (checking modes/types and locating errors) from toolbar.
     - Inferior modes for Ciao and CiaoPP improved: contextual
       help turned on by default.
     - Fixes to set-query. Also, previous query now appears
       in prompt.
     - Improved behaviour of stored query.
     - Improved behaviour of recentering, finding errors, etc.
     - Wait for prompt has better termination characteristics.
     - Added new interactive entry points (M-x): ciao,
       prolog, ciaopp.
     - Better tracking of last inferior buffer used.
     - Miscellanous bugs removed; some colors changed to
       adapt to different Emacs versions.
     - Fixed some remaining incompatibilities with xemacs.
     - `:- doc` now also supported and highlighted.
     - Eliminated need for calendar.el
     - Added some missing library directives to fontlock
       list, organized this better.  
 
 - New libraries added to the system:
   - hiord: new library which needs to be loaded in order to use
     higher-order call/N and P(X) syntax. Improved model for predicate
     abstractions.
   - fuzzy: allows representing fuzzy information in the form or
     Prolog rules.
   - use_url: allows loading a module remotely by using a WWW
     address of the module source code
   - andorra: alternative search method where goals which become
     deterministic at run time are executed before others.
   - iterative deepening (id): alternative search method which makes a
     depth-first search until a predetermined depth is reached.
     Complete but in general cheaper than breadth first.
   - det_hook: allows making actions when a deterministic
     situation is reached.
   - ProVRML: read VRML code and translate it into Prolog terms,
     and the other way around.
   - `io_alias_redirection`: change where stdin/stdout/stderr point to
     from within Ciao programs.
   - `tcl_tk`: an interface to Tcl/Tk programs.
   - `tcl_tk_obj`: object-based interface to Tcl/Tk graphical
     objects.
   - CiaoPP: options to interface with the CiaoPP Prolog preprocessor. 
 
 - Some libraries greatly improved:
   - WebDB: utilities to create WWW-based database interfaces.
   - Improved java interface implementation (this forced
     renaming some interface primitives).
   - User-transparent persistent predicate database revamped:
     - Implemented `passerta_fact/1` (`asserta_fact/1`).
     - Now it is never necessary to explicitly call
       `init_persdb`, a call to `initialize_db` is only needed
       after dynamically defining facts of `persistent_dir/2`.
       Thus, `pcurrent_fact/1` predicate eliminated.
     - Facts of persistent predicates included in the
       program code are now included in the persistent
       database when it is created. They are ignored in
       successive executions.
     - Files where persistent predicates reside are now
       created inside a directory named as the module where
       the persistent predicates are defined, and are named
       as F_A\* for predicate F/A.
     - Now there are two packages: `persdb` and `persdb/ll`
       (for low level). In the first, the standard builtins
       `asserta_fact/1`, `assertz_fact/1`, and retract_fact/1
       are replaced by new versions which handle persistent
       data predicates, behaving as usual for normal data
       predicates. In the second package, predicates with
       names starting with 'p' are defined, so that there is
       not overhead in calling the standard builtins.
     - Needed declarations for `persistent_dir/2` are now
       included in the packages. 
   
   - SQL now works with mysql.
   - system: expanded to contain more predicates which act as
     interface to the underlying system / operating system. 
 
 - Other libraries improved:
   - xref: creates cross-references among Prolog files.
   - concurrency: new predicates to create new concurrent
     predicates on-the-fly.
   - sockets: bugs corrected.
   - objects: concurrent facts now properly recognized.
   - fast read/write: bugs corrected.
   - Added 'webbased' protocol for active modules: publication of
     active module address can now be made through WWW.
   - Predicates in library(dynmods) moved to library(compiler).
   - Expansion and meta predicates improved.
   - Pretty printing.
   - Assertion processing.
   - Module-qualified function calls expansion improved.
   - Module expansion calls goal expansion even at runtime. 
 
 - Updates to builtins (there are a few more; these are the most
   relevant):
   
   - Added a prolog_flag to retrieve the version and patch.
   - `current_predicate/1` in `library(dynamic)` now enumerates
     non-engine modules, `prolog_sys:current_predicate/2` no longer
     exists.
   - `exec/*` bug fixed.
   - `srandom/1` bug fixed. 
 
 - Updates for C interface:
   - Fixed bugs in already existing code.
   - Added support for creation and traversing of Prolog data
     structures from C predicates.
   - Added support for raising Prolog exceptions from C
     predicates.
   - Preliminary support for calling Prolog from C. 
 
 - Miscellaneous updates:
   - Installation made more robust.
   - Some pending documentation added.
   - 'ciao' script now adds (locally) to path the place where
     it has been installed, so that other programs can be located
     without being explicitly in the \$PATH.
   - Loading programs is somewhat faster now.
   - Some improvement in printing path names in Windows.
