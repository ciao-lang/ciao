# Contributing to Ciao Prolog

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Ciao Prolog! Below are
guidelines to help you report issues, suggest features, or contribute
code.

## Reporting Issues

We greatly appreciate your efforts in reporting bugs or requesting new
features. Please follow these steps:

1. **Search Existing Issues**: Check if a similar issue already
   exists.
2. **Provide Clear Details**: Include steps to reproduce the bug,
   expected behavior, and your environment (e.g., OS, Ciao version).
3. **Feature Requests**: Explain why the feature is important and how
   it could enhance the project.

For guidance on open source contributions, we recommend
[opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/).

## Understanding Ciao Prolog’s Development

Ciao Prolog is a free, open-source system. However, addressing issues
or implementing features requires time and resources, which are often
limited. Here’s how we approach contributions:

- **Bug Fixes**: All reported bugs are reviewed and classified. Fixes
  are prioritized based on alignment with project goals and available
  resources.
- **Dormant Issues**: Some issues may remain unresolved for extended
  periods. This does not imply a lack of interest.
- **Feature Requests**: Not all requests can be implemented,
  particularly if they conflict with Ciao’s design. Such requests will
  be clearly marked and closed.

We encourage discussions to clarify details and welcome pull requests
for contributions.

## Missing Features

While sharing a common language kernel, Prolog systems vary widely in
their features. Ciao offers many unique and advanced capabilities but
there may be some feature found in another system that is not
supported. If a missing feature impacts your project, let us
know. Collaboration on implementing such features is always welcome.

## Contributing Code

To contribute code:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Clone your fork to make changes locally.
2. **Create a Feature Branch**: Use a descriptive name (e.g.,
   `fix-issue-123` or `add-new-feature`).
3. **Follow Coding Guidelines**: Ensure your code adheres to the
   project’s style and standards.
4. **Write Tests**: Add tests to verify your changes.
5. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**: Provide a clear description of your
   changes, referencing any related issues.

Your contributions are invaluable, and we look forward to
collaborating with you!
